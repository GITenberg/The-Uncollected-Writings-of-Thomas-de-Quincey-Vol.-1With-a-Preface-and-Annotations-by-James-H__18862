<p>'<i>The last fruit off an old tree!</i>' This, in the words
of <span class="smcap">Walter Savage Landor</span>, is what I have now the
honour to set before the public in these hitherto
'<span class="smcap">Uncollected Writings of Thomas De Quincey.</span>'</p>

<p>It was my privilege to be associated intimately
with the Author some thirty to forty years ago&mdash;from
the beginning of 1850 until his death in 1859.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Throughout the whole period during which he was
engaged in preparing for the Press his <i>Selections
Grave and Gay</i>, I assisted in the task.</p>

<p>Of the singularly pleasant literary intercourse of
that memorable time I have given some reminiscences
in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> for this month. I may yet
combine in a Volume with these some amusing,
scholarly letters in my possession, and a Selection of
Papers from the original sources, which I feel warranted,
by the Author's own estimate, in calling <i>De
Quincey's Choice Works</i>. Meantime, in dealing with
the various Essays and Stories here gathered together,
I limit myself to such notes as are necessary to point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg vi]</a></span>
out the special circumstances under which some of
the papers were written; in others the nature of
the evidence I have found as to the indisputable
authorship.</p>

<p>My special opportunities, derived from constant
companionship and the continuous discussion with <span class="smcap">De
Quincey</span> of matters concerning his writings, gave me
the key to some of the admirable papers here reprinted.
It also entitles me to say, that he would have included
a number of them in his Collected Works alongside
the <i>Suspiria de Profundis</i> (Sighs from the Depths),
had he lived to continue his labours.</p>

<p>When we find that most part of the <i>Suspiria</i>&mdash;perhaps
the highest reach of his intellect in impassioned
power&mdash;did not appear in the <i>Selections</i> at all, the
reader will at once understand that, in the Author's
own opinion, the Essays and Stories now first collected,
were neither less dignified in purpose nor less finished
in style than those which had passed under his hand
in the fourteen volumes he nearly completed. Rather
like the <i>Suspiria</i>, some of these papers were reserved
as material upon the revision of which his energy
might be fitly bestowed when health would permit.</p>

<hr />

<p>The interesting papers which appeared in <i>Tait's
Magazine</i> are all duly vouched for in that periodical.
I have not touched any of the autobiographical matter
which appeared in <i>Tait</i>,&mdash;the Author having recast
that as well as the <i>Sketches from Childhood</i>, published
in <i>The Instructor</i> in the 'Autobiographic Sketches'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg vii]</a></span>
with which he opened the <i>Selections</i>. <i>The Casuistry
of Duelling</i>, indeed, appeared in <i>Tait</i> as part of the
Autobiographic Series, but, practically, it stood as an
independent paper. The touching personal passage
in this article reveals the misery caused by the
unbridled scurrility of certain notorious publications
of the last generation.</p>

<p>The paper on <i>The German Language</i> appeared in
<i>Tait</i> in June 1836, and the <i>Brief Appraisal of Greek
Literature</i> in December 1838 and June 1839.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two long and valuable papers on <i>Education;
Plans for the Instruction of Boys in Large Numbers</i>,
which appeared in <i>The London Magazine</i> for April
and May, 1824, were duly authenticated by the
following characteristic letter from <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> to
<span class="smcap">Christopher North</span>. It appears in <i>Professor Wilson's
Life</i>, written by his daughter, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Gordon</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>London, Thursday, February 24th, 1825.</i></p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">My dear Wilson</span>,</p>

<p>'I write to you on the following occasion:&mdash;Some
time ago, perhaps nearly two years ago, Mr.
Hill, a lawyer, published a book on Education, detailing
a plan on which his brothers had established a
school at Hazlewood, in Warwickshire. This book I
reviewed in the <i>London Magazine</i>, and in consequence
received a letter of thanks from the Author, who, on
my coming to London about midsummer last year,
called on me. I have since become intimate with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg viii]</a></span>
him, and, excepting that he is a sad Jacobin (as I am
obliged to tell him once or twice a month), I have
no one fault to find with him, for he is a very clever,
amiable, good creature as ever existed; and in particular
directions his abilities strike me as really very
great indeed. Well, his book has just been reviewed
in the last <i>Edinburgh Review</i> (of which some copies
have been in town about a week). This service has
been done him, I suppose, <i>through</i> some of his political
friends&mdash;(for he is connected with Brougham, Lord
Lansdowne, old Bentham, etc.),&mdash;but I understand
<i>by</i> Mr. Jeffrey. Mr. Hill, in common with multitudes
in this Babylon&mdash;who will not put their trust
in Blackwood as in God (which, you know, he ought
to do)&mdash;yet privately adores him as the Devil; and
indeed publicly too, is a great <i>pr&ocirc;neur</i> of Blackwood.
For, in spite of his Jacobinism, he is liberal and
inevitably just to real wit. His fear is&mdash;that Blackwood
may come as Nemesis, and compel him to
regorge any puffing and cramming which Tiff has
put into his pocket, and is earnest to have a letter
addressed in an influential quarter to prevent this.
I alleged to him that I am not quite sure but it is an
affront to a Professor to presume that he has any
connection as contributor, or anything else, to any
work which he does not publicly avow as his organ
for communicating with the world of letters. He
answers that it would be so in him,&mdash;but that an old
friend may write <i>sub rosa</i>. I rejoin that I know not
but you may have cut Blackwood&mdash;even as a subscriber&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg ix]</a></span>
whole lustrum ago. He rebuts, by urging
a just compliment paid to you, as a supposed contributor,
in the <i>News of Literature and Fashion</i>, but
a moon or two ago. Seriously, I have told him that
I know not what was the extent of your connection
with Blackwood at <i>any</i> time; and that I conceive
the labours of your Chair in the University must
now leave you little leisure for any but occasional
contributions, and therefore for no regular cognizance
of the work as director, etc. However, as all that
he wishes&mdash;is simply an interference to save him from
any very severe article, and not an article in his
favour, I have ventured to ask of you if you hear
of any such thing, to use such influence as must
naturally belong to you in your general character
(whether maintaining any connection with Blackwood
or not) to get it softened. On the whole, I
suppose no such article is likely to appear. But to
oblige Hill I make the application. He has no <i>direct</i>
interest in the prosperity of Hazlewood; he is himself
a barrister in considerable practice, and of some
standing, I believe; but he takes a strong paternal
interest in it, all his brothers (who are accomplished
young men, I believe) being engaged in it. They
have already had one shock to stand: a certain Mr.
Place, a Jacobin friend of the School till just now,
having taken the pet with it&mdash;and removed his sons.
Now this Mr. Place, who was formerly a tailor&mdash;leather-breeches
maker and habit-maker,&mdash;having
made a fortune and finished his studies,&mdash;is become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg x]</a></span>
an immense authority as a political and reforming
head with Bentham, etc., as also with the <i>Westminster
Review</i>, in which quarter he is supposed to have the
weight of nine times nine men; whence, by the way,
in the "circles" of the booksellers, the Review has
got the name of the <i>Breeches Review</i>.' ... [The
writer then passes on to details of his own plans and
prospects, and thus concludes.]</p>

<p>'I beg my kind regards to Mrs. Wilson and my
young friends, whom I remember with so much
interest as I last saw them at Elleray.&mdash;I am, my
dear Wilson,</p>

<p>
'Very affectionately yours,<br />
'<span class="smcap">Thomas De Quincey.</span>'<br />
</p>

<hr />

<p>In approaching the consideration of other papers
said, in various quarters (with some show of authority)
to have been written by <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span>, it was necessary
to act with extreme care. One was a painstaking
list on the whole, but very inaccurate as regards
certain contributions attributed to <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> in
<i>Blackwood</i>. I have had the kind aid of <span class="smcap">Messrs.
Blackwood</span> in examining the archives of <i>Maga</i> to
settle the points in question.</p>

<p>I was puzzled by some papers in <i>The London
Magazine</i> set down as <span class="smcap">De Quincey's</span> contributions
in a memorandum said to have been furnished by
<span class="smcap">Messrs. Taylor</span> and <span class="smcap">Hessey</span>, its Publishers. The
<i>Blackwood</i> blunders made me very sceptical. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg xi]</a></span>
was one story in particular&mdash;the long droll one
of <i>Mr. Schnackenberger; or, Two Masters to one
Dog</i>, about which I remained in doubt.</p>

<p>I had a faint recollection that one day <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span>
dwelt on the merits of '<span class="smcap">Juno</span>,' and owned the story
when he was discussing 'bull-dogs.'</p>

<p>By the way, he was rather fond of 'bull-dogs,'
and had some good anecdotes about them. It was a
kind of pet-admiration-horror which he shared with
<span class="smcap">Southey</span>, on account of the difficulty in making a
well-bred bull-dog relax his grip. Some member of
the canine 'fancy' down at the Lakes had given them
a so-called infallible 'tip' for making a bull-dog let
go. I am sorry to say I have quite forgotten this
admirable receipt. To be sure, one ought never to
forget such valuable pieces of information. So I
thought one day lately before the muzzling order
came into force, when a bloodthirsty monster,&mdash;a big,
white bull-dog, sprang suddenly at me in Cleveland
Gardens. Instantly there flashed the thought&mdash;what
was it that <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> recommended? A
lucky lunge which drove the ferule of my umbrella
down the brute's throat fortunately created a
diversion, and allowed a little more time for the
study of the problem. Perhaps I will be pardoned
this digression, as it affords an opportunity of recording
the fact that <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> and <span class="smcap">Southey</span> both
looked up to the bull-dog as an animal of very
decided 'character.'</p>

<p>I was loth to abandon <i>Mr. Schnackenberger</i>, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg xii]</a></span>
unwilling to lean too much on my somewhat
hazy remembrance. It seemed almost hopeless to
obtain the necessary evidence. <span class="smcap">Messrs. Taylor</span> and
<span class="smcap">Hessey</span> were long dead, and after groping about like
a detective, no one could tell me what had become
of the records of <i>The London Magazine</i>. Suddenly
there came light in October last. I ascertained that a
son of one of the Publishers is the <span class="smcap">Archdeacon</span> of
<span class="smcap">Middlesex</span>, the Venerable <span class="smcap">J. A. Hessey, D.C.L.</span></p>

<p>I stated the case, and the worthy <span class="smcap">Archdeacon</span>
came most kindly and promptly to my assistance.
As a boy he remembered <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> at his
father's house, and recollected very well reading <i>Mr.
Schnackenberger</i>. He informed me, 'I was greatly
interested in the [London] Magazine generally, so
much so, that, at my father's request, I copied from
his private list, and attached to the head of each
paper the name of the Author.... This interesting
set came to me at my father's death.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hessey</span> had subsequently presented the series
to his old pupil, <span class="smcap">Mr. William Carew Hazlitt</span> (by
whose courtesy I have been able to examine it)&mdash;'the
grandson of <span class="smcap">William Hazlitt</span>, who was a frequent
writer in the Magazine, and an old friend of my
father. I thought he would like to possess it, and
that it would thus be in fitting hands. I should not
have parted with it in favour of any but a man like
<span class="smcap">Mr. Hazlitt</span>, who was sure to value it.'</p>

<p>As these valuable annotations of the <span class="smcap">Archdeacon</span>
ramify in various directions&mdash;touching as they do the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
contributions of many brilliant men of that period&mdash;it
may not be amiss (as a possible help to others in
the future) to add a few more decisive words by
<span class="smcap">Dr. Hessey</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>'If any papers are not marked (he refers only to
those volumes actually published by <span class="smcap">Messrs. Taylor</span>
and <span class="smcap">Hessey</span>) it was because they were anonymous,
or because, from some inadvertency, they were not
assigned in my father's list. <i>So far as the record goes,
it may be depended upon.</i>'</p>

<p>By its help I was able to fix the authorship by
<span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> of (1) <i>The Dog Story</i>&mdash;translated from
the German, (2) <i>Moral Effects of Revolutions</i>, (3)
<i>Prefigurations of Remote Events</i>, (4) <i>Abstract of
Swedenborgianism by Immanuel Kant</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Another perplexing element was the letter written
by <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> to his uncle, <span class="smcap">Colonel Penson</span>, in
1819 (<span class="smcap">Page's</span> <i>Life</i>, vol. i. p. 207), wherein reference
is made to certain contributions to <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i> and <i>The Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

<p>The archives of <i>Maga</i> I find go back only as far
as 1825. As to <i>The Quarterly Review</i>, I have <span class="smcap">Mr.
Murray's</span> authority for stating that <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span>
never wrote a line in it. Whether any contributions
were ever commissioned, paid for, and afterwards
suppressed, I have been unable to ascertain. As a
matter of fact, the <i>Schiller</i> Series referred to in the
letter to <span class="smcap">Colonel Penson</span> was never reviewed in
<i>The Quarterly</i> at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg xiv]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> as a Newspaper Editor forms the
subject of a Chapter in <span class="smcap">Page's</span> <i>Life</i>. Some extracts
are there given from cuttings out of <i>The Westmorland
Gazette</i> found amongst the Author's Papers. This
editorship (1818-19) was of short duration, and pursued
under hostile circumstances, such as distance
from the Press, &amp;c., which soon led to <span class="smcap">De Quincey's</span>
resignation. I had hoped to add some further specimens
of the newspaper work, but have not, as yet,
obtained access to a file of the period. In any
future edition I may be able to add this in an
Appendix.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>The Love-Charm.</i>&mdash;In spite of the marvellous
tenacity of <span class="smcap">De Quincey's</span> memory, even as to the
very words of a passage in an Author which he
had, perhaps, only <i>once</i> read, there were <i>blanks</i>
which confounded himself. One of these bore on
his contributions to <span class="smcap">Knight's</span> <i>Quarterly Magazine</i>.
<span class="smcap">Mr. Fields</span> had been so generally careful in obtaining
sufficient authority for what he published,
in the original American edition, that <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span>
good-humouredly gave the verdict against himself,
and 'supposed he <i>must</i> be wrong' in thinking that
some of these special papers were not from his pen.
Still,&mdash;he demurred, and before including them in
<i>The Selections Grave and Gay</i>, it was resolved to
institute an inquiry. Accordingly, about 1852, I
was deputed to interview <span class="smcap">Mr. Charles Knight</span>,
and request his aid. My mission was to obtain, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg xv]</a></span>
possible, a correct list of the various contributions to
the <i>Quarterly Magazine</i>, including this <i>Love-Charm</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Knight, Mr. Ramsay</span> (his first lieutenant, as he
called him), and myself all met at Fleet Street, where
we had the archives of the old <i>Quarterly Magazine</i>
turned up, and a list checked. I lately found this
particular story also referred to circumstantially in
the annexed paragraph contained in <span class="smcap">Charles Knight's</span>
<i>Passages of a Working Life</i> (<span class="smcap">Thorne's</span> re-issue, vol. I.
chap. x. p. 339).</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> had written to me in December 1824,
in the belief that, as he expressed it, "many of your
friends will rally about you, and urge you to some new
undertaking of the same kind. If that should happen,
I beg to say, that you may count upon me, as one of
your men, for any extent of labour, to the best of my
power, which you may choose to command." He wrote
a translation of <i>The Love-Charm</i> of <span class="smcap">Tieck</span>, with a
notice of the Author. This is not reprinted in his
Collected Works, though perhaps it is the most interesting
of his translations from the German. In
this spring and summer <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> and I were in
intimate companionship. It was a pleasant time of
intellectual intercourse for me.'</p>

<p>There is no doubt <i>The Love-Charm</i> would have been
reprinted had the Author lived to carry the <i>Selections</i>
farther.</p>

<hr />

<p>The curious little Essay <i>On Novels</i>,&mdash;written in a
Lady's Album, had passed out of <span class="smcap">Mr. Davey's</span> hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
before I became aware of its existence. The <i>facsimile</i>,
however, taken for <i>The Archivist</i>, by an expert
like <span class="smcap">Mr. Netherclift</span>, shows that it is, unquestionably,
in the handwriting of <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span>. I have
been unable to trace the '<span class="smcap">Fair Incognita</span>' to whom
it was addressed.</p>

<hr />

<p>The compositions which were written for me when
I edited <i>Titan</i>, and which I now place before the
public in volume form, after the lapse of a whole
generation (thirty-three years, to speak 'by the card'),
demand some special comment, particularly in their
relation to the <i>Selections Grave and Gay</i>.</p>

<p><i>Titan</i> was a half-crown monthly Magazine, a continuation
in an enlarged form of <i>The Instructor</i>. I
had become the acting Editor of its predecessor, <i>the
New Series</i> of <i>The Instructor</i>, working in concert with
my Father, the proprietor. In this <i>New Series</i> there
appeared from <span class="smcap">De Quincey's</span> pen <i>The Sphinx's Riddle</i>,
<i>Judas Iscariot</i>, the Series of <i>Sketches from Childhood</i>,
and other notable papers.</p>

<p>At that time I was but a young editor&mdash;young
and, perhaps, a little 'curly,' as <span class="smcap">Lord Beaconsfield</span>
put it. <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span>, with a truly paternal solicitude,
gave me much good advice and valuable help, both
in the selection of subjects for the Magazine and
in the mode of handling them. The notes on <i>The
Lake Dialect</i>, <i>Shakspere's Text and Suetonius Unravelled</i>,
were written to me in the form of Letters,
and published in <i>Titan</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Storms in English History</i> was a consideration of
part of <span class="smcap">Mr. Froude's</span> well-known book, which on its
publication made a great stir in the literary world,
and profoundly impressed <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span>.</p>

<p><i>How to write English</i> was the first of a series projected
for <i>The Instructor</i>. It never got beyond this
'Introduction,' but the fragment contains some matter
well worthy of preservation.</p>

<p>The circumstances attending the composition of the
four papers on <i>The English in India</i> and <i>The English
in China</i>, I have explained at some length in the
introductory notices attached to them.</p>

<p>And now for a confession! The 'gentle reader'
may, perhaps, feel a momentary inclination to blame
me when I reveal, that I rather stood in the way
of some brilliant articles which were very seriously
considered at this period.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> was eager to write them, and I should
have been glad indeed to have had them for <i>Titan</i>,
but for a fear of allowing the Author to wander too
far from the ever-present and irksome <i>Works</i>. Any
possible escape&mdash;even through other downright hard
work, from this perplexing labour was joyfully hailed
by him as a hopeful chance of obtaining a prosperous
holiday.</p>

<p>For a little I wavered under the temptation (Reader,&mdash;was
it not great?)&mdash;the idea of having a little
relaxation which would permit some, at least, of
these well-planned papers to be written. But I was
keenly alive to the danger which overtook us at last.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
We are daily reminded that 'art is long and life is
short.' I had already saved the <i>Works</i> from being
strangled at their birth in a legal tussle with <span class="smcap">Mr.
John Taylor</span>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> My Father was at my elbow anxiously
inquiring about the progress of the 'copy' for each
succeeding volume. There were eager friends also, on
both sides of the Atlantic, pressing resolutely for it.
So&mdash;prudence prevailed, and we held as straightly
on our way as the Author's uncertain health would
permit.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass, dear Public, that you lost
some charming essays, while you gained the fourteen
volumes of the <i>Selections</i> which the Author all but
completed.</p>

<p>Wherefore, seeing that you may possibly expect it
of me to make some use of my rare opportunities by
doing whatever I can in these matters, 'before the
night cometh,'&mdash;I have prepared this book&mdash;<i>ohne
hast, ohne rast</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot close these few pages better than by
quoting some strong, just, sympathetic words which
appeared in two great reviews&mdash;one American, the
other British.</p>

<p><i>The North American Review</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'In <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> we are struck at once by the
exquisite refinement of mind, the subtleness of association,
and the extreme tenuity of the threads of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg xix]</a></span>
thought, the gossamer filaments yet finally weaving
themselves together, and thickening imperceptibly
into a strong and expanded web. Mingled with this,
and perhaps springing from a similar mental habit,
is an occasional dreaminess both in speculation and
in narrative, when the mind seems to move vaguely
round in vast returning circles. The thoughts catch
hold of nothing, but are heaved and tossed like
masses of cloud by the wind. An incident of trivial
import is turned and turned to catch the light of
every possible consequence, and so magnified as to
become portentous and terrible.'</p>

<hr />

<p>'A barren and trivial fact, under the power of
that life-giving hand, shoots out on all sides into
waving branches and green leaves, and odoriferous
flowers. It is not the fact that interests us, but the
mind working upon it, investing it with mock-heroic
dignity, or rendering it illustrative of really serious
principles; or, with the true insight of genius, discovering,
in that which a vulgar eye would despise,
the germs of grandeur and beauty; the passions of
war in the contests of the rival factions of schoolboys,
the tragedy in every peasant's death-bed.'</p>

<hr />

<p>'<span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> constantly amazes us by the amount
and diversity of his learning. Two or three of the
minor papers in the collected volumes are absolutely
loaded with the life spoils of their author's scholarship,
yet carry their burden as lightly as our bodies sustain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg xx]</a></span>
the weight of the circumambient atmosphere. So
perfect is his tact in finding, or rather making a place
for everything, that, while inviting, he eludes the
charge of pedantry.'</p>

<hr />

<p>'It is scarcely to be expected that one who
tries his hand at so many kinds of pencraft should
always excel; yet such is the force of <span class="smcap">De Quincey's</span>
intellect, the brilliancy of his imagination, and the
charm of his style, that he throws a new and peculiar
interest over every subject which he discusses, while
his fictitious narratives in general rivet the attention
of the reader with a power not easily resisted.'</p>

<p><i>The Quarterly Review</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">De Quincey's</span> style is superb, his powers of reasoning
unsurpassed, his imagination is warm and
brilliant, and his humour both masculine and delicate.'</p>

<p>The writer continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>'A great master of English composition, a critic of
uncommon delicacy, an honest and unflinching investigator
of received opinions, a philosophic inquirer&mdash;<span class="smcap">De Quincey</span>
has departed from us full of years, and
left no successor to his rank. The exquisite finish of
his style, with the scholastic vigour of his logic, form
a combination which centuries may never reproduce,
but which every generation should study as one of
the marvels of English Literature.'</p>

<h2><a name="23" id="A_BRIEF_APPRAISAL_OF_THE_GREEK"></a>A BRIEF APPRAISAL OF THE GREEK
LITERATURE IN ITS FOREMOST PRETENSIONS:</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>By way of Counsel to Adults who are hesitating as to the Propriety
of Studying the Greek Language with a view to the
Literature; and by way of consolation to those whom circumstances
have obliged to lay aside that plan.</i></p></div>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>No. I.</h3>

<p>No question has been coming up at intervals for
reconsideration more frequently than that which
respects the comparative pretensions of Pagan (viz.
Greek and Roman) Literature on the one side, and
Modern (that is, the Literature of Christendom) on
the other. Being brought uniformly before unjust
tribunals&mdash;that is, tribunals corrupted and bribed by
their own vanity&mdash;it is not wonderful that this great
question should have been stifled and overlaid with
peremptory decrees, dogmatically cutting the knot
rather than skilfully untying it, as often as it has
been moved afresh, and put upon the roll for a re-hearing.
It is no mystery to those who are in the
secret, and who can lay A and B together, why it
should have happened that the most interesting of all
literary questions, and the most comprehensive (for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
it includes most others, and some special to itself),
has, in the first place, never been pleaded in a style
of dignity, of philosophic precision, of feeling, or of
research, proportioned to its own merits, and to the
numerous 'issues' (forensically speaking) depending
upon it; nor, in the second place, has ever received
such an adjudication as was satisfactory <i>even at the
moment</i>. For, be it remembered, after all, that any
provisional adjudication&mdash;one growing out of the
fashion or taste of a single era&mdash;could not, at any
rate, be binding for a different era. A judgment
which met the approbation of Spenser could hardly
have satisfied Dryden; nor another which satisfied
Pope, have been recognised as authentic by us of the
year 1838. It is the normal or exemplary condition
of the human mind, its ideal condition, not its abnormal
condition, as seen in the transitory modes and
fashions of its taste or its opinions, which only</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Can lay great bases for eternity,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or give even a colourable permanence to any decision
in a matter so large, so perplexed, so profound, as
this great pending suit between antiquity and ourselves&mdash;between
the junior men of this earth and
ourselves, the seniors, as Lord Bacon reasonably calls
us. Appeals will be brought <i>ad infinitum</i>&mdash;we ourselves
shall bring appeals, to set aside any judgment
that may be given, until something more is consulted
than individual taste; better evidence brought forward
than the result of individual reading; something
higher laid down as the <i>grounds</i> of judgment, as the
very principles of the jurisprudence which controls
the court, than those vague <i>responsa prudentum</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
countersigned by the great name, perhaps, of Aristotle,
but still too often mere products of local convenience,
of inexperience, of experience too limited
and exclusively Grecian, or of absolute caprice&mdash;rules,
in short, which are themselves not less truly <i>sub
judice</i> and liable to appeal than that very appeal cause
to which they are applied as decisive.</p>

<p>We have remarked, that it is no mystery why the
decision should have gone pretty uniformly in favour
of the ancients; for here is the dilemma:&mdash;A man,
attempting this problem, <i>is</i> or <i>is not</i> a classical
scholar. If he <i>is</i>, then he has already received a bias
in his judgment; he is a bribed man, bribed by his
vanity; and is liable to be challenged as one of the
judges. If he is <i>not</i>, then he is but imperfectly
qualified&mdash;imperfectly as respects his knowledge and
powers; whilst, even as respects his will and affections,
it may be alleged that he also is under a bias
and a corrupt influence; his interest being no less
obvious to undervalue a literature, which, as to
<i>him</i>, is tabooed and under lock and key, than his
opponent's is to put a preposterous value upon that
knowledge which very probably is the one sole
advantageous distinction between him and his
neighbours.</p>

<p>We might cite an illustration from the French
literary history on this very point. Every nation in
turn has had its rows in this great quarrel, which is,
in fact, co-extensive with the controversies upon
human nature itself. The French, of course, have
had <i>theirs</i>&mdash;solemn tournaments, single duels, casual
'turn-ups,' and regular 'stand-up' fights. The most
celebrated of these was in the beginning of the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
century, when, amongst others who acted as bottle-holders,
umpires, &amp;c., two champions in particular
'peeled' and fought a considerable number of rounds,
mutually administering severe punishment, and both
coming out of the ring disfigured: these were M. la
Motte and Madame Dacier. But Motte was the
favourite at first, and once he got Dacier 'into
chancery,' and 'fibbed' her twice round the ropes, so
that she became a truly pitiable and delightful spectacle
to the connoisseurs in fibbing and bloodshed.
But here lay the difference: Motte was a hard hitter;
he was a clever man, and (which all clever men are
not) a man of sense; but, like Shakspeare, he had no
Greek. On the other hand, Dacier had nothing <i>but</i>
Greek. A certain abb&eacute;, at that time, amused all
Paris with his caricatures of this Madame Dacier,
'who,' said he, 'ought to be cooking her husband's
dinner, and darning his stockings, instead of skirmishing
and tilting with Grecian spears; for, be it
known that, after all her <i>not cooking</i> and her <i>not
darning</i>, she is as poor a scholar as her injured husband
is a good one.' And <i>there</i> the abb&eacute; was right;
witness the husband's <i>Horace</i>, in 9 vols., against the
wife's <i>Homer</i>. However, this was not generally understood.
The lady, it was believed, waded petticoat-deep
in Greek clover; and in any Grecian field of
dispute, naturally she must be in the right, as against
one who barely knew his own language and a little
Latin. Motte was, therefore, thought by most people
to have come off second best. For, as soon as ever
he opened thus&mdash;'Madame, it seems to me that,
agreeably to all common sense or common decorum,
the Greek poet should here'&mdash;&mdash;instantly, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
listening to his argument, the intrepid Amazon replied
(&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#961;&#945; &#953;&#948;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;), 'You foolish man! you remarkably
silly man!&mdash;<i>that</i> is because you know no better;
and the reason you know no better, is because you
do not understand <i>ton d'apameibomenos</i> as I do.' <i>Ton
d'apameibomenos</i> fell like a hand-grenade amongst
Motte's papers, and blew him up effectually in the
opinion of the multitude. No matter what he might
say in reply&mdash;no matter how reasonable, how unanswerable&mdash;that
one spell of 'No Greek! no Greek!'
availed as a talisman to the lady both for offence
and defence; and refuted all syllogisms and all eloquence
as effectually as the cry of <i>&Agrave; la lanterne!</i> in
the same country some fourscore years after.</p>

<p>So it will always be. Those who (like Madame
Dacier) possess no accomplishment <i>but</i> Greek, will, of
necessity, set a superhuman value upon that literature
in all its parts, to which their own narrow skill
becomes an available key. Besides that, over and
above this coarse and conscious motive for overrating
that which reacts with an equal and answerable
overrating upon their own little philological attainments,
there is another agency at work, and quite
unconsciously to the subjects of that agency, in disturbing
the sanity of any estimate they may make
of a foreign literature. It is the habit (well known
to psychologists) of transferring to anything created
by our own skill, or which reflects our own skill,
as if it lay causatively and objectively<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in the reflecting
thing itself, that pleasurable power which in
very truth belongs subjectively to the mind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
him who surveys it, from conscious success in the
exercise of his own energies. Hence it is that we
see daily without surprise, young ladies hanging
enamoured over the pages of an Italian author,
and calling attention to trivial commonplaces, such
as, clothed in plain mother English, would have
been more repulsive to them than the distinctions
of a theologian, or the counsels of a great-grandmother.
They mistake for a pleasure yielded by the
author, what is in fact the pleasure attending their
own success in mastering what was lately an insuperable
difficulty.</p>

<p>It is indeed a pitiable spectacle to any man of sense
and feeling, who happens to be really familiar with
the golden treasures of his own ancestral literature,
and a spectacle which moves alternately scorn and
sorrow, to see young people squandering their time
and painful study upon writers not fit to unloose the
shoes' latchets of many amongst their own compatriots;
making painful and remote voyages after
the drossy refuse, when the pure gold lies neglected
at their feet. Too often he is reminded of a case,
which is still sometimes to be witnessed in London.
Now and then it will happen that a lover of art,
modern or antique alike, according to its excellence,
will find himself honoured by an invitation from some
millionnaire, or some towering grandee, to 'assist,' as
the phrase is, at the opening of a case newly landed
from the Tiber or the Arno, and fraught (as he is
assured) with the very gems of Italian art, inter-mingled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
besides with many genuine antiques. He
goes: the cases are solemnly disgorged; adulatory
hangers on, calling themselves artists, and, at all
events, so much so as to appreciate the solemn farce
enacted, stand by uttering hollow applauses of my
Lord's taste, and endeavouring to play upon the
tinkling cymbals of spurious enthusiasm: whilst
every man of real discernment perceives at a glance
the mere refuse and sweeping of a third-rate <i>studio</i>,
such as many a native artist would disdain to turn
out of his hands; and antiques such as could be produced,
with a month's notice, by cart-loads, in many
an obscure corner of London. Yet for this rubbish
has the great man taken a painful tour; compassed
land and sea; paid away in exchange a king's
ransom; and claims now on their behalf, the very
humblest homage of artists who are taxed with the
basest envy if they refuse it, and who, meantime,
cannot in sincerity look upon the trumpery with
other feelings than such as the potter's wheel, if (like
Ezekiel's wheels) it were instinct with spirit, would
entertain for the vilest of its own creations;&mdash;culinary
or 'post-culinary' mugs and jugs. We, the writers
of this paper, are not artists, are not connected with
artists. And yet, upon the general principle of sympathy
with native merit, and of disgust towards all
affectation, we cannot but recall such anecdotes with
scorn; and often we recollect the stories recorded by
poor Benvenuto Cellini, that dissolute but brilliant
vagabond, who (like our own British artists) was sometimes
upbraided with the degeneracy of modern art,
and, upon his humbly requesting some evidence, received,
by way of practical answer, a sculptured gem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
or vase, perhaps with a scornful demand of&mdash;when
would he be able to produce anything like that&mdash;'eh,
Master Ben? Fancy we must wait a few centuries
or so, before you'll be ready with the fellow of this.'
And, lo! on looking into some hidden angle of the
beautiful production, poor Cellini discovered his own
private mark, the supposed antique having been a
pure forgery of his own. Such cases remind one too
forcibly of the pretty Horatian tale, where, in a contest
between two men who undertake to mimic a pig's
grunting, he who happens to be the favourite of the
audience is applauded to the echo for his felicitous
execution, and repeatedly encored, whilst the other man
is hissed off the stage, and well kicked by a band of
amateurs and cognoscenti, as a poor miserable copyist
and impostor; but, unfortunately for the credit of his
exploders, he has just time, before they have quite
kicked him off, for exposing to view the real pig concealed
under his cloak, which pig it was, and not
himself, that had been the artist&mdash;forced by pinches
into 'mimicry' of his own porcine music. Of all
baffled connoisseurs, surely, these Roman pig-fanciers
must have looked the most confounded. Yet there
is no knowing: and we ourselves have a clever friend,
but rather too given to subtilising, who contends,
upon some argument not perfectly intelligible to us,
that Horace was not so conclusive in his logic as he
fancied; that the real pig might not have an 'ideal'
or normal squeak, but a peculiar and non-representative
squeak; and that, after all, the man might
deserve the 'threshing' he got. Well, it may be so;
but, however, the Roman audience, wrong or not, for
once fancied themselves in the wrong; and we cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
but regret that our own ungenerous disparagers of
native merit, and <i>exclusive</i> eulogisers of the dead or
the alien&mdash;of those only '<i>quos Libitina sacravit</i>,' or
whom oceans divide from us&mdash;are not now and then
open to the same <i>palpable</i> refutation, as they are certainly
guilty of the same mean error, in prejudging
the whole question, and refusing to listen even to the
plain evidence of their own feelings, or, in some cases,
to the voice of their own senses.</p>

<p>From this preface it is already abundantly clear
what side <i>we</i> take in this dispute about modern literature
and the antique.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And we now propose to
justify our leaning by a general review of the Pagan
authors, in their elder section&mdash;that is, the Grecians.
These will be enough in all conscience, for one essay;
and even for them we meditate a very cursory inquest;
not such as would suffice in a grand ceremonial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
day of battle&mdash;a <i>justum pr&oelig;lium</i>, as a Roman
would call it&mdash;but in a mere perfunctory skirmish,
or (if the reader objects to that word as pedantic,
though, really, it is a highly-favoured word amongst
ancient divines, and with many a</p>

<p>why, in that case, let us indulge his fastidious taste
by calling it an autoschediastic combat, to which,
surely, there can be no such objection. And as the
manner of the combat is autoschediastic or extemporaneous,
and to meet a hurried occasion, so is the
reader to understand that the object of our disputation
is not the learned, but the unlearned student;
and our purpose, not so much to discontent the one
with his painful acquisitions, as to console the other
under what, upon the old principle of <i>omne ignotum
pro magnifico</i>, he is too apt to imagine his irreparable
disadvantages. We set before us, as our especial
auditor, the reasonable man of plain sense but strong
feeling, who wishes to know how much he has lost,
and what injury the gods did him, when, though
making him, perhaps, poetical, they cut short his
allowance of Latin, and, as to Greek, gave him not a
jot more than a cow has in her side pocket.</p>

<p>Let us begin at the beginning&mdash;and that, as everybody
knows, is Homer. He is, indeed, so much at
the beginning that, for that very reason (if even
there were no other), he is, and will be ever more,
supremely interesting. Is the unlearned reader
aware of his age? Upon that point there are more
hypotheses than one or even two. Some there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
among the chronologers who make him eleven hundred
years anterior to Christ. But those who allow
him least, place him more than nine&mdash;that is, about
two centuries before the establishment of the Grecian
Olympiads, and (which is pretty nearly the same
thing as regards time) before Romulus and Remus.
Such an antiquity as this, even on its own account,
is a reasonable object of interest. A poet to whom
the great-grandfather of old Ancus Martius (his
grandfather, did we say&mdash;that is, avus?&mdash;nay, his
<i>abavus</i>, his <i>atavus</i>, his <i>tritavus</i>) looked back as to one
in a line with his remote ancestor&mdash;a poet who, if he
travelled about as extensively as some have supposed
him to do, or even as his own countryman Herodotus
most certainly did five or six hundred years afterwards,
might have conversed with the very workmen
who laid the foundations of the first temple at Jerusalem&mdash;might
have bent the knee before Solomon in
all his glory:&mdash;Such a poet, were he no better than
the worst of our own old metrical romancers, would&mdash;merely
for his antiquity, merely for the sublime
fact of having been coeval with the eldest of those
whom the eldest of histories presents to our knowledge;
coeval with the earliest kings of Judah, older
than the greatest of the Judean prophets, older than
the separation of the two Jewish crowns and the
revolt of Israel, and, even with regard to Moses and
to Joshua, not in any larger sense junior than as we
ourselves are junior to Chaucer&mdash;purely and exclusively
with regard to these pretensions, backed and
supported by an antique form of an antique language&mdash;the
most comprehensive and the most melodious
in the world, would&mdash;could&mdash;should&mdash;ought to merit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
a filial attention; and, perhaps with those who had
waggon-loads of time to spare, might plead the benefit,
beyond most of those in whose favour it was enacted,
of that Horatian rule&mdash;</p>

<p>In fact, when we recollect that, in round numbers,
we ourselves may be considered as two thousand
years in advance of Christ, and that (by assuming
less even than a mean between the different dates
assigned to Homer) he stands a thousand years before
Christ, we find between Homer and ourselves a gulf
of three thousand years, or about one clear half of
the total extent which we grant to the present duration
of our planet. This in itself is so sublime a
circumstance in the relations of Homer to our era,
and the sense of power is so delightfully titillated
to that man's feeling, who, by means of Greek, and
a very moderate skill in this fine language, is able
to grasp the awful span, the vast arch of which one
foot rest upon 1838, and the other almost upon the
war of Troy&mdash;the mighty rainbow which, like the
archangel in the Revelation, plants its western
limb amongst the carnage and the magnificence of
Waterloo, and the other amidst the vanishing gleams
and the dusty clouds of Agamemnon's rearguard&mdash;that
we may pardon a little exultation to the man
who can actually mutter to himself, as he rides home
of a summer evening, the very words and vocal music
of the old blind man at whose command</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p><p>But pleasures in this world fortunately are without
end. And every man, after all, has many pleasures
peculiar to himself&mdash;pleasures which no man shares
with him, even as he is shut out from many of other
men. To renounce one in particular, is no subject
for sorrow, so long as many remain in that very class
equal or superior. Elwood the Quaker had a luxury
which none of us will ever have, in hearing the very
voice and utterance of a poet quite as blind as Homer,
and by many a thousand times more sublime. And
yet Elwood was not perhaps much happier for <i>that</i>.
For now, to proceed, reader&mdash;abstract from his
<i>sublime</i> antiquity, and his being the very earliest of
authors, allowance made for one or two Hebrew
writers (who, being inspired, are scarcely to be
viewed as human competitors), how much is there in
Homer, <i>intrinsically</i> in Homer, stripped of his fine
draperies of time and circumstance, in the naked
Homer, disapparelled of the pride, pomp, and circumstance
of glorious antiquity, to remunerate a man for
his labour in acquiring Greek? Men think very differently
about what <i>will</i> remunerate any given labour.
A fool (professional <i>fool</i>) in Shakspeare ascertains,
by a natural process of logic, that a 'remuneration'
means a <i>testern</i>, which is just sixpence; and two
remunerations, therefore, a testoon, or one shilling.
But many men will consider the same service ill paid
by a thousand pounds. So, of the reimbursement for
learning a language. Lord Camden is said to have
learned Spanish, merely to enjoy Don Quixote more
racily. Cato, the elder Cato, after abusing Greek
throughout his life, sat down in extreme old age to
study it: and wherefore? Mr. Coleridge mentions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
an author, in whom, upon opening his pages with
other expectations, he stumbled upon the following
fragrant passage&mdash;'But from this frivolous digression
upon philosophy and the fine arts, let us return to a
subject too little understood or appreciated in these
sceptical days&mdash;the subject of <i>dung</i>.' Now, <i>that</i> was
precisely the course of thought with this old censorious
Cato: So long as Greek offered, or seemed to
offer, nothing but philosophy or poetry, he was
clamorous against Greek; but he began to thaw and
melt a little upon the charms of Greek&mdash;he 'owned
the soft impeachment,' when he heard of some Grecian
treatises upon <i>beans</i> and <i>turnips</i>; and, finally, he
sank under its voluptuous seductions, when he heard
of others upon <span class="smcap">DUNG</span>. There are, therefore, as different
notions about a 'remuneration' in this case, as the
poor fool had met with it in <i>his</i> case. We, however,
unappalled by the bad names of 'Goth,' 'Vandal,'
and so forth, shall honestly lay before the reader <i>our</i>
notions.</p>

<p>When Dryden wrote his famous, indeed matchless,
epigram upon the three great masters (or reputed
masters) of the Epopee, he found himself at no loss
to characterize the last of the triad&mdash;no matter what
qualities he imputed to the first and the second, he
knew himself safe in imputing them all to the third.
The mighty modern had everything that his predecessors
were ever <i>thought</i> to have, as well as something
beside.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> So he expressed the surpassing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
grandeur of Milton, by saying that in him nature had
embodied, by concentration as in one focus, whatever
excellencies she had scattered separately amongst her
earlier favourites. But, in strict regard to the facts,
this is far from being a faithful statement of the
relations between Milton and his elder brothers of
the <i>Epos</i>: in sublimity, if that is what Dryden meant
by 'loftiness of thought,' it is not so fair to class
Milton with the greatest of poets, as to class him
apart, retired from all others, sequestered, 'sole-sitting
by the shores of old romance.' In other poets, in
Dante for example, there may be rays, gleams, sudden
coruscations, casual scintillations, of the sublime; but
for any continuous and sustained blaze of the sublime,
it is in vain to look for it, <i>except</i> in Milton, making
allowances (as before) for the inspired sublimities of
Isaiah, Ezekiel, and of the great Evangelist's Revelations.
As to Homer, no critic who writes from
personal and <i>direct</i> knowledge on the one hand, or
who understands the value of words on the other,
ever contended in any critical sense for sublimity, as
a quality to which he had the slightest pretensions.
What! not Longinus? If he did, it would have been
of little consequence; for he had no field of comparison,
as we, knowing no literature but one&mdash;whereas
we have a range of seven or eight. But he
did not: &#932;&#8056; &#8017;&#968;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#957;,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> or the elevated, in the Longinian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
sense, expressed all, no matter of what origin, of
what tendency, which gives a character of life and
animation to composition&mdash;whatever raises it above
the dead level of flat prosaic style. Emphasis, or
what in an artist's sense gives <i>relief</i> to a passage,
causing it to stand forward, and in advance of what
surrounds it&mdash;that is the predominating idea in the
'sublime' of Longinus. And this explains what
otherwise has perplexed his modern interpreters&mdash;viz.
that amongst the elements of his sublime, he
ranks even the pathetic, <i>i. e.</i> (say they) what by
connecting itself with the depressing passion of grief
is the very counter-agent to the elevating affection of
the sublime. True, most sapient sirs, my very
worthy and approved good masters: but that very
consideration should have taught you to look back,
and reconsider your translation of the capital word
&#8017;&#968;&#959;&#962;. It was rather too late in the day, when you
had waded half-seas over in your translation, to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
out either that you yourselves were ignoramuses, or
that your principal was an ass. 'Returning were as
tedious as go o'er.' And any man might guess how
you would settle such a dilemma. It is, according to
you, a little oversight of your principal: '<i>humanum
aliquid passus est.</i>' We, on the other hand, affirm
that, if an error at all on the part of Longinus, it is
too monstrous for any man to have 'overlooked.' As
long as he could see a pike-staff, he must have seen
that. And, therefore, we revert to <i>our</i> view of the
case&mdash;viz. that it is yourselves who have committed
the blunder, in translating by the Latin word <i>sublimis</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
at all, but still more after it had received new
determinations under modern usage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p><p>Now, therefore, after this explanation, recurring to
the Longinian critiques upon Homer, it will avail any
idolator of Homer but little, it will affect us not much,
to mention that Longinus makes frequent reference
to the <i>Iliad</i>, as the great source of the sublime&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&nbsp;'A quo, ceu fonte perenni,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vatum Pieriis ora rigantur aquis';<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>for, as respected Grecian poets, and as respected <i>his</i>
sense of the word, it cannot be denied that Homer
was such. He was the great well-head of inspiration
to the Pagan poets of after times, who, however (<i>as a
body</i>), moved in the narrowest circle that has ever
yet confined the natural freedom of the poetic mind.
But, in conceding this, let it not be forgotten how
much we concede&mdash;we concede as much as Longinus
demanded; that is, that Homer furnished an ideal
or model of fluent narration, picturesque description,
and the first outlines of what could be called
characteristic delineations of persons. Accordingly,
uninventive Greece&mdash;for we maintain loudly that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Greece, in her poets, <i>was</i> uninventive and sterile
beyond the example of other nations&mdash;received, as a
traditional inheritance, the characters of the Paladins
of the Troad.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Achilles is always the all-accomplished
and supreme amongst these Paladins, the Orlando of
ancient romance; Agamemnon, for ever the Charlemagne;
Ajax, for ever the sullen, imperturbable,
columnar champion, the Mandricardo, the <i>Bergen-op-Zoom</i>
of his faction, and corresponding to our modern
'Chicken' in the pugilistic ring, who was so called
(as the books of the Fancy say) because he was a
'glutton'; and a 'glutton' in this sense&mdash;that he
would take any amount of cramming (<i>i. e.</i> any possible
quantum of 'milling,' or 'punishment'). Ulysses,
again, is uniformly, no matter whether in the solemnities
of the tragic scene, or the festivities of the
Ovidian romance, the same shy cock, but also sly
cock, with the least thought of a white feather in his
plumage; Diomed is the same unmeaning double of
every other hero, just as Rinaldo is with respect to
his greater cousin, Orlando; and so of Teucer,
Meriones, Idomeneus, and the other less-marked
characters. The Greek drama took up these traditional
characters, and sometimes deepened, saddened,
exalted the features&mdash;as Sophocles, for instance, does
with his 'Ajax Flagellifer'&mdash;Ajax the knouter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sheep&mdash;where, by the way, the remorse and penitential
grief of Ajax for his own self-degradation, and
the depth of his affliction for the triumph which he
had afforded to his enemies&mdash;taken in connection
with the tender fears of his wife, Tecmessa, for the
fate to which his gloomy despair was too manifestly
driving him; her own conscious desolation, and the
orphan weakness of her son, in the event which she
too fearfully anticipates&mdash;the final suicide of Ajax;
the brotherly affection of Teucer to the widow and
the young son of the hero, together with the
unlooked-for sympathy of Ulysses, who, instead of
exulting in the ruin of his antagonist, mourns over
it with generous tears&mdash;compose a situation, and a
succession of situations, not equalled in the Greek
tragedy; and, in that instance, we see an effort, rare
in Grecian poetry, of conquest achieved by idealisation
over a mean incident&mdash;viz. the hallucination of brain
in Ajax, by which he mistakes the sheep for his
Grecian enemies, ties them up for flagellation, and
scourges them as periodically as if he were a critical
reviewer. But really, in one extremity of this madness,
where he fixes upon an old ram for Agamemnon,
as the leader of the flock, the &#945;&#957;&#945;&#958; &#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#969;&#957; &#913;&#947;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#956;&#957;&#969;&#957;,
there is an extravagance of the ludicrous against
which, though not exhibited scenically, but simply
narrated, no solemnity of pathos could avail; even in
narration, the violation of tragical dignity is insufferable,
and is as much worse than the hyper-tragic
horrors of <i>Titus Andronicus</i> (a play which is usually
printed, without reason, amongst those of Shakspeare)
as absolute farce or contradiction of all pathos must
inevitably be a worse indecorum than physical horrors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
which simply outrage it by excess. Let us not,
therefore, hear of the judgment displayed upon the
Grecian stage, when even Sophocles, the chief master
of dramatic economy and scenical propriety, could
thus err by an aberration so far transcending the
most memorable violation of stage decorum which
has ever been charged upon the English drama.</p>

<p>From Homer, therefore, were left, as a bequest to
all future poets, the romantic adventures which grow,
as so many collateral dependencies,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'From the tale of Troy divine';<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and from Homer was derived also the discrimination
of the leading characters, which, after all, were but
coarsely and rudely discriminated; at least, for the
majority. In one instance only we acknowledge an
exception. We have heard a great modern poet
dwelling with real and not counterfeit enthusiasm
upon the character (or rather upon the general
picture, as made up both of character and position),
which the course of the <i>Iliad</i> assigns gradually to
Achilles. The view which he took of this impersonation
of human grandeur, combining all gifts of
intellect and of body, matchless speed, strength, inevitable
eye, courage, and the immortal beauty of a
god, being also, by his birth-right, half-divine, and
consecrated to the imagination by his fatal interweaving
with the destinies of Troy, and to the heart
by the early death which to <i>his own knowledge</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
impended over his magnificent career, and so abruptly
shut up its vista&mdash;the view, we say, which our friend
took of the presiding character throughout the <i>Iliad</i>,
who is introduced to us in the very first line, and
who is only eclipsed for seventeen books, to emerge
upon us with more awful lustre;&mdash;the view which he
took was&mdash;that Achilles, and Achilles only, in the
Grecian poetry, was a great idea&mdash;an idealised
creation; and we remember that in this respect he
compared the Homeric Achilles with the Angelica of
Ariosto. Her only he regarded as an idealisation in
the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>. And certainly in the luxury
and excess of her all-conquering beauty, which drew
after her from 'ultimate Cathay' to the camps of the
baptised in France, and back again, from the palace
of Charlemagne, drew half the Paladins, and 'half
Spain militant,' to the portals of the rising sun; that
sovereign beauty which (to say nothing of kings and
princes withered by her frowns) ruined for a time the
most princely of all the Paladins, the supreme Orlando,
crazed him with scorn,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And robbed him of his noble wits outright'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>in all this, we must acknowledge a glorification of
power not unlike that of Achilles:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Irresistible Pelides, whom, unarm'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No strength of man or wild beast could withstand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who tore the lion as the lion tears the kid;<br /></span>

<p>These are the words of Milton in describing that
'heroic Nazarete,' 'God's champion'&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Promis'd by heavenly message twice descending';<br /></span>
</div></div>

<span class="i0">Who from his father's field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode up in flames after his message told';<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>these are the celestial words which describe the
celestial prowess of the Hebrew monomachist, the
irresistible Sampson; and are hardly less applicable
to the 'champion paramount' of Greece confederate.</p>

<p>This, therefore, this unique conception, with what
power they might, later Greek poets adopted; and
the other Homeric characters they transplanted somewhat
monotonously, but at times, we are willing to
admit, and have already admitted, improving and
solemnizing the original epic portraits when brought
upon the stage. But all this extent of obligation
amongst later poets of Greece to Homer serves less
to argue his opulence than their penury. And if,
quitting the one great blazing jewel, the Urim and
Thummim of the <i>Iliad</i>, you descend to individual
passages of poetic effect; and if amongst these a
fancy should seize you of asking for a specimen of the
<i>Sublime</i> in particular, what is it that you are offered
by the critics? Nothing that we remember beyond
one single passage, in which the god Neptune is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
described in a steeple chase, and 'making play' at a
terrific pace. And certainly enough is exhibited of
the old boy's hoofs, and their spanking qualities, to
warrant our backing him against a railroad for a
rump and dozen; but, after all, there is nothing to
grow frisky about, as Longinus does, who gets up the
steam of a blue-stocking enthusiasm, and boils us a
regular gallop of ranting, in which, like the conceited
snipe<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> upon the Liverpool railroad, he thinks himself
to run a match with Sampson; and, whilst affecting
to admire Homer, is manifestly squinting at the
reader to see how far he admires his own flourish of
admiration; and, in the very agony of his frosty
raptures, is quite at leisure to look out for a little
private traffic of rapture on his own account. But it
won't do; this old critical posture-master (whom, if
Aurelian hanged, surely he knew what he was about)
may as well put up his rapture pipes, and (as Lear
says) 'not squiny' at us; for let us ask Master
Longinus, in what earthly respect do these great
strides of Neptune exceed Jack with his seven-league
boots? Let him answer that, if he can. We hold
that Jack has the advantage. Or, again look at the
Koran: does any man but a foolish Oriental think
that passage sublime where Mahomet describes the
divine pen? It is, says he, made of mother-of-pearl;
so much for the 'raw material,' as the economists say.
But now for the size: it can hardly be called a 'portable'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
pen at all events, for we are told that it is so
tall of its age, that an Arabian 'thoroughbred horse
would require 500 years for galloping down the slit
to the nib. Now this Arabic sublime is <i>in this
instance</i> quite a kin brother to the Homeric.</p>

<p>However, it is likely that we shall here be reminded
of our own challenge to the Longinian word &#8017;&#968;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#957;
as not at all corresponding, or even alluding to the
modern word sublime. But in this instance, the distinction
will not much avail that critic&mdash;for no
matter by what particular <i>word</i> he may convey his
sense of its quality, clear it is, by his way of illustrating
its peculiar merit, that, in his opinion, these
huge strides of Neptune's have something supernaturally
grand about them. But, waiving this
solitary instance in Homer of the sublime, according
to his idolatrous critics&mdash;of the pseudo sublime according
to ourselves&mdash;in all other cases where Longinus,
or any other Greek writer has cited Homer as the
great exemplary model of &#8017;&#968;&#959;&#962; in composition, we are
to understand him according to the Grecian sense of
that word. He must then be supposed to praise
Homer, not so much for any ideal grandeur either of
thought, image, or situation, as in a general sense for
his animated style of narration, for the variety and
spirited effect with which he relieves the direct
formal narration in his own person by dialogue between
the subjects of his narration, thus ventriloquising
and throwing his own voice as often as he can
into the surrounding objects&mdash;or again for the similes
and allusive pictures by which he points emphasis to
a situation or interest to a person.</p>

<p>Now then we have it: when you describe Homer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
or when you hear him described as a lively picturesque
old boy [by the way, why does everybody speak of
Homer as old?], full of life, and animation, and movement,
then you say (or you hear say) what is true,
and not much more than what is true. Only about
that word picturesque we demur a little: as a chirurgeon,
he certainly <i>is</i> picturesque; for Howship upon
gunshot wounds is a joke to him when he lectures
upon <i>traumacy</i>, if we may presume to coin that word,
or upon traumatic philosophy (as Mr. M'Culloch says
so grandly, Economic Science). But, apart from this,
we cannot allow that simply to say &#918;&#945;&#954;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#962; &#957;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#945;,
woody Zacynthus, is any better argument of picturesqueness
than Stony Stratford, or Harrow on the
Hill. Be assured, reader, that the Homeric age was
not ripe for the picturesque. <i>Price on the Picturesque</i>,
or, <i>Gilpin on Forest Scenery</i>, would both
have been sent post-haste to Bedlam in those days;
or perhaps Homer himself would have tied a millstone
about their necks, and have sunk them as public
nuisances by woody Zante. Besides, it puts almost
an extinguisher on any little twinkling of the picturesque
that might have flared up at times from this or
that suggestion, when each individual had his own
regular epithet stereotyped to his name like a brass
plate upon a door: Hector, the tamer of horses;
Achilles, the swift of foot; the ox-eyed, respectable
Juno. Some of the 'big uns,' it is true, had a dress
and an undress suit of epithets: as for instance,
Hector was also &#954;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#952;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;, Hector with the tossing
or the variegated plumes. Achilles again was &#948;&#953;&#959;&#962;
or divine. But still the range was small, and the
monotony was dire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, if you come in good earnest to picturesqueness,
let us mention a poet in sober truth worth
five hundred of Homer, and that is Chaucer. Show
us a piece of Homer's handywork that comes within
a hundred leagues of that divine prologue to the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>, or of 'The Knight's Tale,' of the
'Man of Law's Tale,' or of the 'Tale of the Patient
Griseldis,' or, for intense life of narration and festive
wit, to the 'Wife of Bath's Tale.' Or, passing out of
the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> for the picturesque in human
manner and gesture, and play of countenance, never
equalled as yet by Pagan or Christian, go to the
<i>Troilus and Cresseid</i>, and, for instance, to the conversation
between Troilus and Pandarus, or, again,
between Pandarus and Cresseid. Rightly did a critic
of the 17th century pronounce Chaucer a miracle of
natural genius, as having 'taken into the compass
of his <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, the various manners and
humours of the whole English nation in his age; not
a single character has escaped him.' And this critic
then proceeds thus&mdash;'The matter and manner of
these tales, and of their telling, are so suited to their
different educations, humours, and calling, that each
of them would be improper in any other mouth.
Even the grave and serious characters are distinguished
by their several sorts of gravity. Even the
ribaldry of the low characters is different. But there
is such a variety of game springing up before me,
that I am distracted in my choice, and know not
which to follow. It is sufficient to say, according to
the proverb, that here is God's plenty.' And soon
after he goes on to assert (though Heaven knows in
terms far below the whole truth), the superiority of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Chaucer to Boccaccio. And, in the meantime, who
was this eulogist of Chaucer? Why, the man who
himself was never equalled upon this earth, unless by
Chaucer, in the art of fine narration: it is John
Dryden whom we have been quoting.</p>

<p>Between Chaucer and Homer&mdash;as to the main art
of narration, as to the picturesque life of the manners,
and as to the exquisite delineation of character&mdash;the
interval is as wide as between Shakespeare, in
dramatic power, and Nic. Rowe.</p>

<p>And we might wind up this main chapter, of the
comparison between Grecian and English literature&mdash;viz.
the chapter on Homer, by this tight dilemma.
You do or you do not use the Longinian word &#8017;&#968;&#959;&#962; in
the modern sense of the sublime. If you do not, then
of course you translate it in the Grecian sense, as
explained above; and in that sense, we engage to
produce many scores of passages from Chaucer, not
exceeding 50 to 80 lines, which contain more of
picturesque simplicity, more tenderness, more fidelity
to nature, more felicity of sentiment, more animation
of narrative, and more truth of character, than can
be matched in all the <i>Iliad</i> or the <i>Odyssey</i>. On
the other hand, if by &#8017;&#968;&#959;&#962; you choose absurdly to
mean sublimity in the modern sense, then it will
suffice for us that we challenge <i>you</i> to the production
of one instance which truly and incontestably embodies
that quality.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The burthen of proof rests upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
you who affirm, not upon us who deny. Meantime,
as a kind of choke-pear, we leave with the Homeric
adorer this one brace of portraits, or hints for such a
brace, which we commend to his comparison, as
Hamlet did the portraits of the two brothers to his
besotted mother. We are talking of the sublime:
that is our thesis. Now observe: there is a catalogue
in the <i>Iliad</i>&mdash;there is a catalogue in the <i>Paradise
Lost</i>. And, like a river of Macedon and of Monmouth,
the two catalogues agree in that one fact&mdash;viz.
that they <i>are</i> such. But as to the rest, we are
willing to abide by the issue of that one comparison,
left to the very dullest sensibility, for the decision of
the total question at issue. And what is that? Not,
Heaven preserve us! as to the comparative claims of
Milton and Homer in this point of sublimity&mdash;for
surely it would be absurd to compare him who has
most with him whom we affirm to have none at all&mdash;but
whether Homer has the very smallest pretensions
in that point. The result, as we state it, is this:&mdash;The
catalogue of the ruined angels in Milton, is, in
itself taken separately, a perfect poem, with the
beauty, and the felicity, and the glory of a dream.
The Homeric catalogue of ships is exactly on a level
with the muster-roll of a regiment, the register of a
tax-gatherer, the catalogue of an auctioneer. Nay,
some catalogues are far more interesting, and more
alive with meaning. 'But him followed fifty black
ships!'&mdash;'But him follow seventy black ships!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Faugh! We could make a more readable poem out
of an Insolvent's Balance Sheet.</p>

<p>One other little suggestion we could wish to offer.
Those who would contend against the vast superiority
of Chaucer (and him we mention chiefly because he
really has in excess those very qualities of life, motion,
and picturesque simplicity, to which the Homeric
characteristics chiefly tend), ought to bear in mind
one startling fact evidently at war with the <i>degree</i> of
what is claimed for Homer. It is this: Chaucer is
carried naturally by the very course of his tales into
the heart of domestic life, and of the scenery most
favourable to the movements of human sensibility.
Homer, on the other hand, is kept out of that sphere,
and is imprisoned in the monotonies of a camp or a
battle-field, equally by the necessities of his story,
and by the proprieties of Grecian life (which in fact
are pretty nearly those of Turkish life at this day).
Men and women meet only under rare, hurried, and
exclusive circumstances. Hence it is, that throughout
the entire <i>Iliad</i>, we have but one scene in which
the finest affections of the human heart can find an
opening for display; of course, everybody knows at
once that we are speaking of the scene between
Hector, Andromache, and the young Astyanax. No
need for question here; it is Hobson's choice in Greek
literature, when you are seeking for the poetry of
human sensibilities. One such scene there is, and no
more; which, of itself, is some reason for suspecting
its authenticity. And, by the way, at this point, it
is worth while remarking, that a late excellent critic
always pronounced the words applied to Andromache
&#948;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#965;&#959;&#949;&#957; &#947;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#945; (<i>tearfully smiling</i>, or, <i>smiling through</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
<i>her tears</i>), a mere Alexandrian interpolation. And
why? Now mark the reason. Was it because the
circumstance is in itself vicious, or out of nature?
Not at all: nothing more probable or more interesting
under the general situation of peril combined with
the little incident of the infant's alarm at the plumed
helmet. But any just taste feels it to be out of the
Homeric key; the barbarism of the age, not mitigated
(as in Chaucer's far less barbarous age) by the tenderness
of Christian sentiment, turned a deaf ear and a
repulsive aspect to such beautiful traits of domestic
feeling; to Homer himself the whole circumstance
would have been one of pure effeminacy. Now, we
recommend it to the reader's reflection&mdash;and let him
weigh well the condition under which that poetry
moves that cannot indulge a tender sentiment without
being justly suspected of adulterous commerce with
some after age. This remark, however, is by the by;
having grown out of the &#948;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#965;&#959;&#949;&#957; &#947;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#945;, itself a
digression. But, returning from that to our previous
theme, we desire every candid reader to ask himself
what must be the character, what the circumscription,
of that poetry which is limited, by its very subject,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
to a scene of such intense uniformity as a battle or a
camp; and by the prevailing spirit of manners to the
exclusive society of men. To make bricks without
straw, was the excess even of Egyptian bondage;
Homer could not fight up against the necessities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
his age, and the defects of its manners. And the
very apologies which will be urged for him, drawn as
they must be from the spirit of manners prevalent in
his era, are reciprocally but so many reasons for not
seeking in him the kind of poetry which has been
ascribed to him by ignorance, or by defective sensibility,
or by the mere self-interest of pedantry.</p>

<p>From Homer, the route stretches thus:&mdash;The
Grecian drama lies about six hundred years nearer
to the Christian era, and Pindar lies in the interval.
These&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> the Dramatic and Lyric&mdash;are the important
chapters of the Greek poetry; for as to Pastoral
poetry, having only Theocritus surviving, and a very
little of Bion and Moschus, and of these one only
being of the least separate importance&mdash;we cannot
hold that department entitled to any notice in so
cursory a review of the literature, else we have much
to say on this also. Besides that, Theocritus was not
a natural poet, indigenous to Sicily, but an artificial
blue-stocking; as was Callimachus in a different class.</p>

<p>The drama we may place loosely in the generation
next before that of Alexander the Great. And his
era may be best remembered by noting it as 333
years <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> Add thirty years to this era&mdash;that will
be the era of the Drama. Add a little more than a
century, and that will be the era of Pindar. Him,
therefore, we will notice first.</p>

<p>Now, the chief thing to say as to Pindar is&mdash;to
show cause, good and reasonable, why no man of
sense should trouble his head about him. There was
in the seventeenth century a notion prevalent about
Pindar, the very contradiction to the truth. It was
imagined that he 'had a demon'; that he was under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
a burthen of prophetic inspiration; that he was possessed,
like a Hebrew prophet or a Delphic priestess,
with divine fury. Why was this thought?&mdash;simply
because no mortal read him. Laughable it is to
mention, that Pope, when a very young man, and
writing his <i>Temple of Fame</i> (partly on the model
of Chaucer's), when he came to the great columns and
their bas-reliefs in that temple, each of which is sacred
to one honoured name, having but room in all for six,
chose Pindar for one<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of the six. And the first bas-relief
on Pindar's column is so pretty, that we shall
quote it; especially as it suggested Gray's car for
Dryden's 'less presumptuous flight!'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Four swans sustain a car of silver bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heads advanc'd, and pinions stretch'd for flight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, <i>like some furious prophet</i>, Pindar rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seem'd to <i>labour with th' inspiring god</i>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then follow eight lines describing other bas-reliefs,
containing 'the figured games of Greece' (Olympic,
Nemean, &amp;c.). But what we spoke of as laughable in
the whole affair is, that Master Pope neither had
then read one line of Pindar, nor ever read one line
of Pindar: and reason good; for at that time he
could not read the simple Homeric Greek; while the
Greek of Pindar exceeds all other Greek in difficulty,
excepting, perhaps, a few amongst the tragic choruses,
which are difficult for the very same reason&mdash;lyric
abruptness, lyric involution, and lyric obscurity of
transition. Not having read Homer, no wonder that
Pope should place, amongst the bas-reliefs illustrating
the <i>Iliad</i>, an incident which does not exist in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
<i>Iliad</i>.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Not having read Pindar, no wonder that
Pope should ascribe to Pindar qualities which are not
only imaginary, but in absolute contradiction to his
true ones. A more sober old gentleman does not
exist: his demoniac possession is a mere fable. But
there are two sufficient arguments for not reading
him, so long as innumerable books of greater interest
remain unread. First, he writes upon subjects that,
to us, are mean and extinct&mdash;race-horses that have
been defunct for twenty-five centuries, chariots that
were crazy in his own day, and contests with which
it is impossible for us to sympathise. Then his digressions
about old genealogies are no whit better than
his main theme, nor more amusing than a Welshman's
pedigree. The best translator of any age, Mr. Carey,
who translated Dante, has done what human skill
could effect to make the old Theban readable; but,
after all, the man is yet to come who <i>has</i> read Pindar,
<i>will</i> read Pindar, or <i>can</i> read Pindar, except, indeed,
a translator in the way of duty. And the son of
Philip himself, though he bade 'spare the house of
Pindarus,' we vehemently suspect, never read the
works of Pindarus; that labour he left to some future
Hercules. So much for his subjects: but a second
objection is&mdash;his metre: The hexameter, or heroic
metre of the ancient Greeks, is delightful to our
modern ears; so is the Iambic metre fortunately of
the stage: but the Lyric metres generally, and those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of Pindar without one exception, are as utterly without
meaning to us, as merely chaotic labyrinths of
sound, as Chinese music or Dutch concertos. Need
we say more?</p>

<p>Next comes the drama. But this is too weighty
a theme to be discussed slightly; and the more so
because here only we willingly concede a strong
motive for learning Greek; here, only, we hold the
want of a ready introduction to be a serious misfortune.
Our general argument, therefore, which
had for its drift to depreciate Greek, dispenses, in
this case, with our saying anything; since every word
we <i>could</i> say would be hostile to our own purpose.
However, we shall, even upon this field of the Greek
literature, deliver one oracular sentence, tending
neither to praise nor dispraise it, but simply to state
its relations to the modern, or, at least, the English
drama. In the ancient drama, to represent it justly,
the unlearned reader must imagine grand situations,
impressive groups; in the modern tumultuous movement,
a grand stream of action. In the Greek drama,
he must conceive the presiding power to be <i>Death</i>;
in the English, <i>Life</i>. What Death?&mdash;What Life?
That sort of death or of life locked up and frozen into
everlasting slumber, which we see in sculpture; that
sort of life, of tumult, of agitation, of tendency to
something beyond, which we see in painting. The
picturesque, in short, domineers over English tragedy;
the sculpturesque, or the statuesque, over the Grecian.</p>

<p>The moralists, such as Theogins, the miscellaneous
or didactic poets, such as Hesiod, are all alike below
any notice in a sketch like this. The Epigrammatists,
or writers of monumental inscriptions, &amp;c., remain;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and they, next after the dramatic poets, present the
most interesting field by far in the Greek literature;
but these are too various to be treated otherwise than
<i>viritim</i> and in detail.</p>

<p>There remains the prose literature; and, with
the exception of those critical writers who have
written on rhetoric (such as Hermogenes, Dionysius
of Halicarnassus, Demetrius Phalerius, &amp;c. &amp;c., some
of whom are the best writers extant, on the mere art
of constructing sentences, but could not interest the
general reader), the prose writers may be thus distributed:
1st, the orators; 2nd, the historians; 3rd,
the philosophers; 4th, the literateurs (such as
Plutarch, Lucian, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>As to the philosophers, of course there are only two
who can present any general interest&mdash;Plato and
Aristotle; for Xenophon is no more a philosophic
writer than our own Addison. Now, in this department,
it is evident that the matter altogether transcends
the manner. No man will wish to study a
profound philosopher, but for some previous interest
in his doctrines; and, if by any means a man has
obtained this, he may pursue this study sufficiently
through translations. It is true that neither Sydenham
nor Taylor has done justice to Plato, for example,
as respects the colloquial graces of his style; but,
when the object is purely to pursue a certain course
of principles and inferences, the student cannot complain
much that he has lost the dramatic beauties of
the dialogue, or the luxuriance of the style. These
he was not then seeking, by the supposition&mdash;what he
<i>did</i> seek, is still left; whereas in poetry, if the golden
apparel is lost, if the music has melted away from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the thoughts, all, in fact, is lost. Old Hobbes, or
Ogilbie, is no more Homer than the score of Mozart's
<i>Don Giovanni</i> is Mozart's <i>Don Giovanni</i>.</p>

<p>If, however, Grecian philosophy presents no absolute
temptations to the attainment of Greek, far less
does Grecian history. If you except later historians&mdash;such
as Diodorus, Plutarch, and those (like Appian,
Dionysius, Dion Cassius) who wrote of Roman things
and Roman persons in Greek, and Polybius, who
comes under the same class, at a much earlier period&mdash;and
none of whom have any interest of style,
excepting only Plutarch: these dismissed, there are
but three who can rank as classical Greek historians;
<i>three who can lose by translation</i>. Of these the eldest,
Herodotus, is perhaps of real value. Some call him
the father of history; some call him the father of lies.
Time and Major Rennel have done him ample justice.
Yet here, again, see how little need of Greek for the
amplest use of a Greek author. Twenty-two centuries
and more have passed since the fine old man read his
history at the Grecian games of Olympia. One man
only has done him right, and put his enemies under
his footstool; <i>and yet this man had no Greek</i>. Major
Rennel read Herodotus only in the translation of
Beloe. He has told us so himself. Here, then, is a
little fact, my Grecian boys, that you won't easily get
over. The father of history, the eldest of prose
writers, has been first explained, illustrated, justified,
liberated from scandal and disgrace, first had his
geography set to rights, first translated from the
region of fabulous romance, and installed in his
cathedral chair, as Dean (or eldest) of historians,
by a military man, who had no more Greek than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Shakspeare, or than we (perhaps you, reader) of the
Kalmuck.</p>

<p>Next comes Thucydides. He is the second in order
of time amongst the Grecian historians who survive,
and the first of those (a class which Mr. Southey, the
laureate, always speaks of as the corruptors of genuine
history) who affect to treat it philosophically.
If the philosophic historians are not always so
faithless as Mr. Southey alleges, they are, however,
always guilty of dulness. Commend us to one picturesque,
garrulous old fellow, like Froissart, or Philip
de Comines, or Bishop Burnet, before all the philosophic
prosers that ever prosed. These picturesque
men will lie a little now and then, for the sake of
effect&mdash;but so will the philosophers. Even Bishop
Burnet, who, by the way, was hardly so much a picturesque
as an anecdotal historian, was famous for
his gift of lying; so diligently had he cultivated it.
And the Duchess of Portsmouth told a noble lord,
when inquiring into the truth of a particular fact
stated by the very reverend historian, that he was
notorious in Charles the Second's court, and that no
man believed a word he said. But now Thucydides,
though writing about his own time, and doubtless
embellishing by fictions not less than his more amusing
brethren, is as dull as if he prided himself on
veracity. Nay, he tells us no secret anecdotes of the
times&mdash;surely there must have been many; and this
proves to us, that he was a low fellow without political
connections, and that he never had been behind
the curtain. Now, what business had such a man to
set himself up for a writer of history and a speculator
on politics? Besides, his history is imperfect; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
suppose it were not, what is its subject? Why simply
one single war; a war which lasted twenty-seven
years; but which, after all, through its whole course
was enlivened by only two events worthy to enter
into general history&mdash;viz. the plague of Athens, and
the miserable licking which the Athenian invaders
received in Sicily. This dire overthrow dished
Athens out and out; for one generation to come,
there was an end of Athenian domination; and that
arrogant state, under the yoke of their still baser
enemies of Sparta, learned experimentally what were
the evils of a foreign conquest. There was therefore,
in the domination of the Thirty Tyrants, something
to 'point a moral' in the Peloponnesian war: it was
the judicial reaction of martial tyranny and foreign
oppression, such as we of this generation have beheld
in the double conquest of Paris by insulted and outraged
Christendom. But nothing of all this will be
found in Thucydides&mdash;he is as cool as a cucumber
upon every act of atrocity; whether it be the bloody
abuse of power, or the bloody retribution from the
worm that, being trampled on too long, turns at last
to sting and to exterminate&mdash;all alike he enters in his
daybook and his ledger, posts them up to the account
of brutal Spartan or polished Athenian, with no more
expression of his feelings (if he had any) than a merchant
making out an invoice of puncheons that are to
steal away men's wits, or of frankincense and myrrh
that are to ascend in devotion to the saints. Herodotus
is a fine, old, genial boy, that, like Froissart or
some of the crusading historians, kept himself in
health and jovial spirits by travelling about; nor did
he confine himself to Greece or the Grecian islands;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
but he went to Egypt, got bousy in the Pyramid of
Cheops, ate a beef-steak in the hanging-gardens of
Babylon, and listened to no sailors' yarns at the
Pir&aelig;us, which doubtless, before his time, had been
the sole authority for Grecian legends concerning
foreign lands. But, as to Thucydides, our own
belief is, that he lived like a monk shut up in his
<i>museum</i> or study; and that, at the very utmost, he
may have gone in the steamboat<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> to Corfu (<i>i. e.</i>
Corcyra), because <i>that</i> was the island which occasioned
the row of the Peloponnesian war.</p>

<p>Xenophon now is quite another sort of man; he
could use his pen; but also he could use his sword;
and (when need was) his heels, in running away.
His Grecian history of course is a mere fraction of
the general history; and, moreover, our own belief,
founded upon the differences of the style, is, that the
work now received for his must be spurious. But in
this place the question is not worth discussing. Two
works remain, professedly historical, which, beyond a
doubt, <i>are</i> his; and one of them the most interesting
prose work by much which Athens has bequeathed
us; though, by the way, Xenophon was living in a
sort of elegant exile at a chateau in Thessaly, and not
under Athenian protection, when he wrote it. Both
of his great works relate to a Persian Cyrus, but to
a Cyrus of different centuries. The <i>Cyrop&aelig;dia</i> is
a romance, pretty much on the plan of Fenelon's
<i>Telemaque</i>, only (Heaven be praised!) not so furiously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
apoplectic. It pursues the great Cyrus, the
founder of the Persian empire, the Cyrus of the
Jewish prophets, from his infancy to his death-bed;
and describes evidently not any real prince, according
to any authentic record of his life, but, upon some
basis of hints and vague traditions, improves the
actual Cyrus into an ideal fiction of a sovereign and
a military conqueror, as he <i>ought</i> to be. One thing
only we shall say of this work, though no admirers
ourselves of the twaddle which Xenophon elsewhere
gives us as philosophic memorabilia, that the episode
of Abradates and Panthea (especially the behaviour
of Panthea after the death of her beloved hero, and
the incident of the dead man's hand coming away on
Cyrus grasping it) exceeds for pathos everything in
Grecian literature, always excepting the Greek drama,
and comes nearest of anything, throughout Pagan
literature, to the impassioned simplicity of Scripture,
in its tale of Joseph and his brethren. The other
historical work of Xenophon is the <i>Anabasis</i>. The
meaning of the title is <i>the going-up</i> or <i>ascent</i>&mdash;viz. of
Cyrus the younger. This prince was the younger
brother of the reigning king Artaxerxes, nearly two
centuries from Cyrus the Great; and, from opportunity
rather than a better title, and because his mother
and his vast provincial government furnished him
with royal treasures able to hire an army, most of
all, because he was richly endowed by nature with
personal gifts&mdash;took it into his head that he would
dethrone his brother; and the more so, because he
was only his half-brother. His chance was a good
one: he had a Grecian army, and one from the very
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of Greece; whilst the Persian king had but a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
small corps of Grecian auxiliaries, long enfeebled
by Persian effeminacy and Persian intermarriages.
Xenophon was personally present in this expedition.
And the catastrophe was most singular, such as does
not occur once in a thousand years. The cavalry of
the great King retreated before the Greeks continually,
no doubt from policy and secret orders; so that,
when a pitched battle became inevitable, the foreign
invaders found themselves in the very heart of the
land, and close upon the Euphrates. The battle was
fought: the foreigners were victorious: they were
actually singing <i>Te Deum</i> or <i>Io P&aelig;an</i> for their victory,
when it was discovered that their leader, the native
prince in whose behalf they had conquered, was
missing; and soon after, that he was dead. What
was to be done? The man who should have improved
their victory, and placed them at his own right hand
when on the throne of Persia, was no more; key they
had none to unlock the great fortresses of the empire,
none to unloose the enthusiasm of the native population.
Yet such was the desperation of their circumstances,
that a <i>coup-de-main</i> on the capital seemed
their best chance. The whole army was and felt
itself a forlorn hope. To go forward was desperate,
but to go back much more so; for they had a thousand
rivers without bridges in their rear; and, if
they set their faces in that direction, they would
have 300,000 light cavalry upon their flanks, besides
nations innumerable&mdash;</p>

<p>fierce fellows who understood no Greek, and, what
was worse, no joking, but well understood the use of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the scymitar. Bad as things were, they soon became
worse; for the chiefs of the Grecian army, being
foolish enough to accept a dinner invitation from the
Persian commander-in-chief, were assassinated; and
the words of Milton became intelligible&mdash;that in the
lowest deep a lower deep had opened to destroy them.
In this dilemma, Xenophon, the historian of the
expedition, was raised to a principal command; and
by admirable skill he led back the army by a different
route to the Black Sea, on the coast of which he
knew that there were Grecian colonies: and from one
of these he obtained shipping, in which he coasted
along (when he did not march by land) to the mouth
of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. This was the
famous retreat of the ten thousand; and it shows
how much defect of literary skill there was in those
days amongst Grecian authors, that the title of the
book, <i>The Going Up</i>, does not apply to the latter
and more interesting seven-eighths of the account.
The Going Up is but the preparation or preface to
the Going Down, the <i>Anabasis</i> to the <i>Katabasis</i>, in
which latter part it is that Xenophon plays any conspicuous
part. A great political interest, however,
over and above the personal interest, attaches to this
expedition: for there can be no doubt, that to this
proof of weakness in the Persian empire, and perhaps
to this, <i>as recorded by Xenophon</i>, was due the expedition
of Alexander in the next generation, which
changed the face of the world.</p>

<p>The literateurs, as we have styled Plutarch and
Lucian, though far removed from the true classical
era, being both posterior to Christianity, are truly
interesting. And, for Lucian in particular, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
he is known by reputation only as a humorous and
sneering writer, we can say, upon our personal knowledge,
that there are passages of more terrific effect,
more German, and approaching to the sublime, than
anywhere else in Greek literature, out of the tragic
poets. Of Plutarch we need hardly speak; one part
of his voluminous works&mdash;viz. his biographies of
Greek and Roman leaders in arts<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and arms&mdash;being
so familiar to all nations; and having been selected
by Rousseau as the book for him who should be
limited (or, like Collins the poet, should limit himself)
to one book only&mdash;a foolish choice undoubtedly, but
still arguing great range of resources in Plutarch,
that he should be thought of after so many myriads of
modern books had widened the range of selection.
Meantime, the reader is not to forget that, whatever
may be his powers of amusement, a more inaccurate
or faithless author as to dates, and, indeed, in all
matters of research, does not exist than Plutarch. We
make it a rule, whenever we see <i>Plut.</i> at the bottom
of a dictionary article, as the authority on which it
rests, to put the better half down as a bouncer.
And, in fact, Joe Miller is quite as good authority
for English history as Plutarch for Roman.</p>

<p>Now remain the orators; and of these we have a
right to speak, for we have read them; and, believe
us, reader, not above one or two men in a generation
have. If the Editor would allow us room, we would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
gladly contrast them with modern orators; and we
could easily show how prodigious are the advantages
of modern orators in every point which can enter
into a comparison. But to what purpose? Even
modern orators, with all the benefit of modern interest,
and of allusions everywhere intelligible, are not
read in any generation after their own, pulpit orators
only being excepted. So that, if the gods <i>had</i> made
our reader a Grecian, surely he would never so far
misspend his precious time, and squander his precious
intellect upon old dusty quarrels, never of more value
to a philosopher than a tempest in a wash-hand bason,
but now stuffed with obscurities which no man can
explain, and with lies to which no man can bring the
counter-statement. But this would furnish matter
for a separate paper.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>No. II.&mdash;THE GREEK ORATORS.</h3>

<p>Now, let us come to the orators. Isocrates, the
eldest of those who have survived, is a mere scholastic
rhetorician: for he was a timid man, and did not
dare to confront the terrors of a stormy political
audience; and hence, though he lived about an entire
century, he never once addressed the Athenian
citizens. It is true, that, although no <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> orator&mdash;for
he never <i>spoke</i> in any usual acceptation of that
word, and, as a consequence, never had an opportunity
of replying, which only can bring forward a man's
talents as a <i>debater</i>&mdash;still he employed his pen upon
real and upon existing questions of public policy;
and did not, as so many generations of chamber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
rhetoricians continued to do in Greece, confine his
powers to imaginary cases of political difficulty, or
(what were tantamount to imaginary) cases fetched
up from the long-past era of King Priam, or the still
earlier era of the Seven Chiefs warring against the
Seven-gated Thebes of B&oelig;otia, or the half-fabulous
era of the Argonauts. Isocrates was a man of sense&mdash;a
patriot in a temperate way&mdash;and with something of
a feeling for Greece generally, not merely a champion
of Athens. His heart was given to politics: and, in
an age when heavy clouds were gathering over the
independence and the civil grandeur of his country,
he had a disinterested anxiety for drawing off the
lightning of the approaching storms by pacific counsels.
Compared, therefore, with the common mercenary
orators of the Athenian forum&mdash;who made a
regular trade of promoting mischief, by inflaming the
pride, jealousy, vengeance, or the martial instincts of
a 'fierce democracy,' and, generally speaking, with no
views, high or low, sound or unsound, that looked
beyond the momentary profit to themselves from thus
pandering to the thoughtless nationality of a most
sensitive people&mdash;Isocrates is entitled to our respect.
His writings have also a separate value, as memorials
of political transactions from which the historian has
gathered many useful hints; and, perhaps, to a diligent
search, they might yield more. But, considered
as an orator&mdash;if that title can be, with any propriety,
allowed to one who declaimed only in his closet&mdash;one
who, in relation to public affairs, was what, in England,
when speaking of practical jurisprudence, we
call a Chamber Counsel&mdash;Isocrates is languid, and
with little of anything characteristic in his manner to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
justify a separate consideration. It is remarkable
that he, beyond all other rhetoricians of that era,
cultivated the <i>rhythmus</i> of his periods. And to this
object he sacrificed not only an enormity of time, but,
I have no doubt, in many cases, the freedom and
natural movement of the thoughts. My reason, however,
for noticing this peculiarity in Isocrates, is by
way of fixing the attention upon the superiority, even
artificial ornaments, of downright practical business
and the realities of political strife, over the torpid
atmosphere of a study or a school. Cicero, long after,
had the same passion for <i>numerositas</i>, and the full,
pompous rotundity of cadence. But in Cicero, all
habits and all faculties were nursed by the daily
practice of life and its impassioned realities, in the
forum or in the senate. What is the consequence?
Why this&mdash;that, whereas in the most laboured performance
of Isocrates (which cost him, I think, one
whole <i>decennium</i>, or period of ten years), few modern
ears are sensible of any striking art, or any great
result of harmony; in Cicero, on the other hand, the
fine, sonorous modulations of his periodic style, are
delightful to the dullest ear of any European. Such
are the advantages from real campaigns, from the
unsimulated strife of actual stormy life, over the
torpid dreams of what the Romans called an <i>umbratic</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
experience.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Isocrates</i> I have noticed as the oldest of the surviving
Greek orators: <i>Demosthenes</i>, of course, claims a
notice more emphatically, as, by universal consent of
Athens, and afterwards of Rhodes, of Rome, and
other impartial judges, the greatest, or, at least, the
most comprehensively great. For, by the way, it
must not be forgotten&mdash;though modern critics <i>do</i>
forget this rather important fact in weighing the
reputation of Demosthenes&mdash;he was not esteemed, in
his own day, as the greatest in that particular quality
of energy and demoniac power (&#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#964;&#951;&#962;) which is
generally assumed to have been his leading characteristic
and his <i>forte</i>; not only by comparison with his
own compatriots, but even with Cicero and the greatest
men of the Roman bar. It was not of Demosthenes
that the Athenians were accustomed to say, 'he
thunders and lightens,' but of Pericles, an elder
orator; and even amongst the written oratory of
Greece, which still survives (for as to the speeches
ascribed to Pericles by Thucydides, I take it for
granted that, as usual, these were mere forgeries of
the historian), there is a portion which perhaps exceeds
Demosthenes in the naked quality of vehemence.
But this, I admit, will not impeach his supremacy;
for it is probable, that wherever an orator is characterised
exclusively by turbulent power, or at least
remembered chiefly for that quality, all the other
numerous graces of eloquence were wanting to that
man, or existed only in a degree which made no
equipoise to his insulated gift of Jovian terror. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Gracchi, amongst the Roman orators, were probably
more properly 'sons of thunder' than Crassus or
Cicero, or even than C&aelig;sar himself, whose oratory, by
the way, was, in this respect, like his own character
and infinite accomplishments; so that even by Cicero
it is rarely cited without the epithet of splendid,
magnificent, &amp;c. We must suppose, therefore, that
neither Cicero nor Demosthenes was held to be at the
head of their respective fields in Rome and Athens, in
right of any absolute pre-eminence in the one leading
power of an orator&mdash;viz. native and fervent vigour&mdash;but
in right of a large comprehensive harmony of
gifts, leaving possibly to some other orators, elder or
rival to themselves, a superiority in each of an orator's
talents taken apart, but claiming the supremacy,
nevertheless, upon the whole, by the systematic union
of many qualities tending to one result: pleasing the
taste by the harmonious <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> from the total
assemblage, and also adapting itself to a far larger
variety of situations; for, after all, the <i>mere</i> son of
thunder is disarmed, and apt to become ridiculous, if
you strip him of a passionate cause, of a theme saturated
with human strife, and of an excitable or
tempestuous audience.</p>

<p>Such an audience, however, it will be said that
Demosthenes had, and sometimes (but not very often
in those orations which survive) such a theme. As
to his audience, certainly it was all that could be
wished in point of violence and combustible passion;
but also it was something more. A mighty advantage
it is, doubtless, to an orator, when he sees and hears
his own kindling passions instantaneously reflected in
the blazing eyes and fiery shouts (the <i>fremitus</i>) of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
audience&mdash;when he sees a whole people, personally or
by deputation, swayed backwards and forwards, like
a field of corn in a breeze, by the movements of his
own appeals. But, unfortunately, in the Athenian
audience, the ignorance, the headstrong violence of
prejudice, the arrogance, and, above all, the levity of
the national mind&mdash;presented, to an orator the most
favourite, a scene like that of an ocean always rocking
with storms; like a wasp always angry; like a
lunatic, always coming out of a passion or preparing
to go into one. Well might Demosthenes prepare
himself by sea-shore practice; in which I conceive
that his purpose must have been, not so much
(according to the common notion) to overcrow the
noise of the forum, as to <i>stand fire</i> (if I may so
express it) against the uproarious demonstrations of
mob fury.</p>

<p>This quality of an Athenian audience must very
seriously have interfered with the intellectual display
of an orator. Not a word could he venture to say in
the way of censure towards the public will&mdash;not even
hypothetically to insinuate a fault; not a syllable
could he utter even in the way of dissent from the
favourite speculations of the moment. If he did,
instantly a roar of menaces recalled him to a sense
even of personal danger. And, again, the mere
vivacity of his audience, requiring perpetual amusement
and variety, compelled a man, as great even as
Demosthenes, to curtail his arguments, and rarely,
indeed, to pursue a theme with the requisite fulness
of development or illustration; a point in which the
superior dignity and the far less fluctuating mobility of
the Roman mind gave an immense advantage to Cicero.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Demosthenes, in spite of all the weaknesses which
have been arrayed against his memory by the hatred
of his contemporaries, or by the anti-republican feelings
of such men as Mitford, was a great man and
an honest man. He rose above his countrymen. He
despised, in some measure, his audience; and, at
length, in the palmy days of his influence, he would
insist on being heard; he would insist on telling the
truth, however unacceptable; he would not, like the
great rout of venal haranguers, lay any flattering
unction to the capital distempers of the public mind;
he would point out their errors, and warn them of
their perils. But this upright character of the man,
victorious over his constitutional timidity, does but
the more brightly illustrate the local law and the
tyranny of the public feeling. How often do we find
him, when on the brink of uttering 'odious truth,'
obliged to pause, and to propitiate his audience with
deprecatory phrases, entreating them to give him time
for utterance, not to yell him down before they had
heard his sentence to the end. &#924;&#951; &#952;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#949;&mdash;'Gentlemen
of Athens! for the love of God, do not make an
uproar at what I am going to say! Gentlemen of
Athens! humbly I beseech you to let me finish my
sentence!' Such are his continual appeals to the
better feelings of his audience. Now, it is very
evident that, in such circumstances, no man could do
justice to any subject. At least, when speaking not
before a tribunal of justice, but before the people in
council assembled&mdash;that is, in effect, on his greatest
stage of all&mdash;Demosthenes (however bold at times,
and restive in a matter which he held to be paramount)
was required to bend, and did bend, to the local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
genius of democracy, reinforced by a most mercurial
temperament. The very air of Attica, combined with
great political power, kept its natives in a state of
habitual intoxication; and even wise men would have
had some difficulty in mastering, as it affected
themselves, the permanent bias towards caprice and
insolence.</p>

<p>Is this state of things at all taken into account in
our modern critiques upon Demosthenes? The upshot
of what I can find in most modern lecturers upon
rhetoric and style, French or English, when speaking
of Demosthenes, is this notable simile, by way of
representing the final effect of his eloquence&mdash;'that,
like a mountain torrent, swollen by melting snow, or
by rain, it carries all things before it.' Prodigiously
original! and exceedingly discriminative! As if such
an illustration would not equally represent the effect
of a lyrical poem, of Mozart's music, of a stormy
chorus, or any other form whatever of impassioned
vehemence. Meantime, I suspect grievously that not
one of these critics has ever read a paragraph of
Demosthenes. Nothing do you ever find quoted but
a few notorious passages about Philip of Macedon,
and the too-famous oath, by the manes of those that
died at Marathon. I call it too famous, because (like
Addison's comparison of Marlborough, at Blenheim,
to the angel in the storm&mdash;of which a schoolmaster
then living said, that nine out of every ten boys
would have hit upon it in a school exercise) it has no
peculiar boldness, and must have occurred to every
Athenian, of any sensibility, every day of his life.
Hear, on the other hand, a modern oath, and (what
is most remarkable) an oath sworn in the pulpit. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
dissenting clergyman (I believe, a Baptist), preaching
at Cambridge, and having occasion to affirm or to
deny something or other, upon his general confidence
in the grandeur of man's nature, the magnificence of
his conceptions, the immensity of his aspirations, &amp;c.,
delivered himself thus:&mdash;'By the greatness of human
ideals&mdash;by the greatness of human aspirations&mdash;by
the immortality of human creations&mdash;<i>by the Iliad</i>&mdash;<i>by
the Odyssey</i>'&mdash;Now, that <i>was</i> bold, startling,
sublime. But, in the other case, neither was the oath
invested with any great pomp of imagery or expression;
nor, if it had&mdash;which is more to the purpose&mdash;was
such an oath at all representative of the peculiar
manner belonging to Demosthenes. It is always a
rude and inartificial style of criticism to cite from an
author that which, whether fine or not in itself, is no
fair specimen of his ordinary style.</p>

<p>What then <i>is</i> the characteristic style of Demosthenes?&mdash;It
is one which grew naturally, as did his
defects (by which I mean faults of <i>omission</i>, in
contradiction to such as are positive), from the
composition of his audience. His audience, comprehending
so much ignorance, and, above all, so much
high-spirited impatience, being, in fact, always on the
fret, kept the orator always on the fret. Hence
arose short sentences; hence, the impossibility of the
long, voluminous sweeps of beautiful rhythmus which
we find in Cicero; hence, the animated form of
apostrophe and crowded interrogations addressed to
the audience. This gives, undoubtedly, a spirited and
animated character to the style of Demosthenes; but
it robs him of a large variety of structure applied to
the logic, or the embellishment, or the music of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
composition. His style is full of life, but not (like
Cicero's) full of pomp and continuous grandeur. On
the contrary, as the necessity of rousing attention, or
of sustaining it, obliged the Attic orator to rely too
much on the <i>personality</i> of direct question to the
audience, and to use brief sentences, so also the same
impatient and fretful irritability forbade him to linger
much upon an idea&mdash;to theorise, to speculate, or,
generally, to quit the direct business path of the
question then under consideration&mdash;no matter for
what purpose of beauty, dignity, instruction, or even
of <i>ultimate</i> effect. In all things, the <i>immediate</i>&mdash;the
instant&mdash;the <i>pr&aelig;sens pr&aelig;sentissimum</i>, was kept steadily
before the eye of the Athenian orator, by the mere
coercion of self-interest.</p>

<p>And hence, by the way, arises one most important
feature of distinction between Grecian oratory (political
oratory at least) on the one hand, and Roman (to
which, in this point, we may add British) on the
other. A Roman lawyer, senator, or demagogue,
even, under proper restrictions&mdash;a British member of
parliament&mdash;or even a candidate from the hustings&mdash;but,
most assuredly, and by the evidence of many a
splendid example, an advocate addressing a jury&mdash;may
embellish his oration with a wide circuit of
historical, or of antiquarian, nay, even speculative
discussion. Every Latin scholar will remember the
leisurely and most facetious, the good-natured and
respectful, yet keenly satiric, picture which the great
Roman barrister draws of the Stoic philosophy, by
way of <i>rowing</i> old Cato, who professed that philosophy
with too little indulgence for venial human errors.
The <i>judices</i>&mdash;that is, in effect, the jury&mdash;were tickled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
to the soul by seeing the grave Marcus Cato badgered
with this fine razor-like raillery; and there can be no
doubt that, by flattering the self-respect of the jury,
in presuming them susceptible of so much wit from a
liberal kind of knowledge, and by really delighting
them with such a display of adroit teasing applied to
a man of scenical gravity, this whole scene, though
quite extrajudicial and travelling out of the record,
was highly useful in conciliating the good-will of
Cicero's audience. The same style of liberal <i>excursus</i>
from the more thorny path of the absolute business
before the court, has been often and memorably
practised by great English barristers&mdash;as, in the trial
of Sacheverel, by many of the managers for the
Commons; by 'the fluent Murray,' on various occasions;
in the great cause of impeachment against our
English Verres (or, at least, our Verres as to the
situation, though not the guilt), Mr. Hastings; in
many of Mr. Erskine's addresses to juries, where
political rights were at stake; in Sir James Mackintosh's
defence of Peltier for a libel upon Napoleon,
when he went into a history of the press as applied to
politics&mdash;(a liberal inquiry, but which, except in the
remotest manner, could not possibly bear upon the
mere question of fact before the jury); and in many
other splendid instances, which have really made <i>our</i>
trials and the annals of <i>our</i> criminal jurisprudence
one great fund of information and authority to the
historian. In the senate, I need not say how much
farther, and more frequently, this habit of large
generalisation, and of liberal excursion from perhaps
a lifeless theme, has been carried by great masters;
in particular, by Edmund Burke, who carried it, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
fact, to such excess, and to a point which threatened
so much to disturb the movement of public business,
that, from that cause more perhaps than from rude
insensibility to the value of his speculations, he put
his audience sometimes in motion for dinner, and
acquired (as is well-known) the surname of the
Dinner Bell.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Now, in the Athenian audience, all this was impossible:
neither in political nor in forensic harangues
was there any license by rule, or any indulgence by
usage, or any special privilege by personal favour, to
the least effort at improving an individual case of law
or politics into general views of jurisprudence, of
statesmanship, of diplomacy; no collateral discussions
were tolerated&mdash;no illustrative details&mdash;no historical
parallelisms&mdash;still less any philosophical moralisations.
The slightest show of any tendency in these directions
was summarily nipped in the bud: the Athenian
gentlemen began to &#952;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; in good earnest if a man
showed symptoms of entering upon any discussion
whatever that was not intensely needful and pertinent
in the first place&mdash;or which, in the second place, was
not of a nature to be wound up in two sentences when
a summons should arise either to dinner, or to the
theatre, or to the succession of some variety anticipated
from another orator.</p>

<p>Hence, therefore, finally arises one great peculiarity
of Greek eloquence; and a most unfortunate one for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
its chance of ever influencing a remote posterity, or,
in any substantial sense, of its ever surviving in the
real unaffected admiration of us moderns&mdash;that it
embodies no alien, no collateral information as to
manners, usages, modes of feeling&mdash;no extrinsic ornament,
no side glimpses into Grecian life, no casual
historical details. The cause, and nothing but the
cause&mdash;the political question, and nothing but the
question&mdash;- pealed for ever in the ears of the terrified
orator, always on sufferance, always on his good
behaviour, always afraid, for the sake of his party or
of his client, lest his auditors should become angry, or
become impatient, or become weary. And from that
intense fear, trammeling the freedom of his steps at
every turn, and overruling every motion to the right
or to the left, in pure servile anxiety for the mood
and disposition of his tyrannical master, arose the
very opposite result for us of this day&mdash;that we, by
the very means adopted to prevent weariness in the
immediate auditors, find nothing surviving in Grecian
orations but what <i>does</i> weary us insupportably through
its want of all general interest; and, even amongst
private or instant details of politics or law, presenting
us with none that throw light upon the spirit of
manners, or the Grecian peculiarities of feeling.
Probably an Athenian mob would not have cared
much at the prospect of such a result to posterity;
and, at any rate, would not have sacrificed one atom
of their ease or pleasure to obviate such a result:
but, to an Athenian orator, this result would have
been a sad one to contemplate. The final consequence
is, that whilst all men find, or may find, infinite
amusement, and instruction of the most liberal kind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
in that most accomplished of statesmen and orators,
the Roman Cicero&mdash;nay, would doubtless, from the
causes assigned, have found, in their proportion, the
same attractions in the speeches of the elder Antony,
of Hortensius, of Crassus, and other contemporaries
or immediate predecessors of Cicero&mdash;no person ever
reads Demosthenes, still less any other Athenian
orator, with the slightest interest beyond that which
inevitably attaches to the words of one who wrote his
own divine language with probably very superior
skill.</p>

<p>But, from all this, results a further inference&mdash;viz.
the dire affectation of those who pretend an enthusiasm
in the oratory of Demosthenes; and also a plenary
consolation to all who are obliged, from ignorance
of Greek, to dispense with that novelty. If it be a
luxury at all, it is and can be one for those only
who cultivate verbal researches and the pleasures of
philology.</p>

<p>Even in the oratory of our own times, which oftentimes
discusses questions to the whole growth and
motion of which we have been ourselves parties
present, or even accessary&mdash;questions which we have
followed in their first emersion and separation from
the clouds of general politics; their advance, slow or
rapid, towards a domineering interest in the public
passions; their meridian altitude; and perhaps their
precipitous descent downwards, whether from the
consummation of their objects (as in the questions of
the Slave Trade, of Catholic Emancipation, of East
India Monopoly), or from a partial victory and compromise
with the abuse (as in the purification of that
Augean stable, prisons, and, still more, private houses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
for the insane), or from the accomplishment of one
stage or so in a progress which, by its nature, is
infinite (as in the various steps taken towards the
improvement, and towards the extension of education):
even in cases like these, when the primary
and ostensible object of the speaker already, on its
own account, possesses a commanding attraction, yet
will it often happen that the secondary questions,
growing out of the leading one, the great elementary
themes suggested to the speaker by the concrete case
before him&mdash;as, for instance, the general question
of Test Laws, or the still higher and transcendent
question of Religious Toleration, and the relations
between the State and religious opinions, or the
general history of Slavery and the commerce in the
human species, the general principles of economy as
applied to monopolies, the past usages of mankind in
their treatment of prisoners or of lunatics&mdash;these
comprehensive and transcendent themes are continually
allowed to absorb and throw into the shade,
for a time, the minor but more urgent question of
the moment through which they have gained their
interest. The capital and primary interest gives way
for a time to the derivative interest; and it does so
by a silent understanding between the orator and his
audience. The orator is well assured that he will not
be taxed with wandering; the audience are satisfied
that, eventually, they will not have lost their time:
and the final result is, to elevate and liberalise the
province of oratory, by exalting mere business (growing
originally, perhaps, out of contingencies of finance,
or trade, or local police) into a field for the higher
understanding; and giving to the mere necessities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
our position as a nation the dignity of great problems
for civilising wisdom or philosophic philanthropy.
Look back to the superb orations of Edmund Burke
on questions limited enough in themselves, sometimes
merely personal; for instance, that on American
Taxation, on the Reforms in our Household or Official
Expenditure, or at that from the Bristol hustings (by
its <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> subject, therefore, a mere electioneering
harangue to a mob). With what marvellous
skill does he enrich what is meagre, elevate what is
humble, intellectualise what is purely technical, delocalise
what is local, generalise what is personal!
And with what result? Doubtless to the absolute
contemporaries of those speeches, steeped to the very
lips in the passions besetting their topics, even to
those whose attention was sufficiently secured by the
domineering interest, friendly or hostile, to the views
of the speaker&mdash;even to these I say, that, in so far as
they were at all capable of an intellectual pleasure,
those parts would be most attractive which were least
occupied with the present business and the momentary
details. This order of precedency in the interests of
the speech held even for them; but to us, removing
at every annual step we take in the century, to a
greater distance from the mere business and partisan
interests of the several cases, this secondary attraction
is not merely the greater of the two&mdash;to us it has
become pretty nearly the sole one, pretty nearly the
exclusive attraction.</p>

<p>As to religious oratory, <i>that</i> stands upon a different
footing&mdash;the questions afloat in that province of
human speculation being eternal, or at least essentially
the same under new forms, receives a strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
illustration from the annals of the English senate, to
which also it gives a strong and useful illustration.
Up to the era of James I., the eloquence of either
House could not, for political reasons, be very striking,
on the very principle which we have been enforcing.
Parliament met only for dispatch of business; and
that business was purely fiscal, or (as at times it
happened) judicial. The constitutional functions of
Parliament were narrow; and they were narrowed
still more severely by the jealousy of the executive
government. With the expansion, or rather first
growth and development of a gentry, or third estate,
expanded, <i>pari passu</i>, the political field of their jurisdiction
and their deliberative functions. This widening
field, as a birth out of new existences, unknown
to former laws or usages, was, of course, not contemplated
by those laws or usages. Constitutional
law could not provide for the exercise of rights by a
body of citizens, when, as yet, that body had itself no
existence. A gentry, as the depository of a vast
overbalance of property, real as well as personal, had
not matured itself till the latter years of James I.
Consequently the new functions, which the instinct
of their new situation prompted them to assume, were
looked upon by the Crown, most sincerely, as unlawful
usurpations. This led, as we know, to a most fervent
and impassioned struggle, the most so of any struggle
which has ever armed the hands of men with the
sword. For the passions take a far profounder sweep
when they are supported by deep thought and high
principles.</p>

<p>This element of fervid strife was already, for itself,
an atmosphere most favourable to political eloquence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Accordingly, the speeches of that day, though generally
too short to attain that large compass and sweep of
movement without which it is difficult to kindle or to
sustain any conscious enthusiasm in an audience, were
of a high quality as to thought and energy of expression,
as high as their circumstantial disadvantages
allowed. Lord Strafford's great effort is deservedly
admired to this day, and the latter part of it has been
often pronounced a <i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i>. A few years before
that era, all the orators of note were, and must have
been, judicial orators; and, amongst these, Lord
Bacon, to whom every reader's thoughts will point as
the most memorable, attained the chief object of all
oratory, if what Ben Jonson reports of him be true,
that he had his audience passive to the motions of his
will. But Jonson was, perhaps, too scholastic a judge
to be a fair representative judge; and, whatever he
might choose to say or to think, Lord Bacon was
certainly too weighty&mdash;too massy with the bullion of
original thought&mdash;ever to have realized the idea of a
great popular orator&mdash;one who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Wielded at will a fierce democracy,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and ploughed up the great deeps of sentiment, or
party strife, or national animosities, like a Levanter
or a monsoon. In the schools of Plato, in the <i>pal&aelig;stra
Stoicorum</i>, such an orator might be potent; not <i>in
f&aelig;ce Romuli</i>. If he had laboured with no other defect,
had he the gift of tautology? Could he say the same
thing three times over in direct sequence? For, without
this talent of iteration&mdash;of repeating the same
thought in diversified forms&mdash;a man may utter good
heads of an oration, but not an oration. Just as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
same illustrious man's essays are good hints&mdash;useful
topics&mdash;for essays; but no approximation to what we,
in modern days, understand by <i>essays</i>: they are, as
an eminent author once happily expressed it to myself,
'<i>seeds, not plants or shrubs; acorns, that is, oaks in
embryo, but not oaks</i>.'</p>

<p>Reverting, however, to the oratory of the Senate,
from the era of its proper birth, which we may date
from the opening of that our memorable Long Parliament,
brought together in November of 1642,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> our
Parliamentary eloquence has now, within four years,
travelled through a period of two centuries. A most
admirable subject for an essay, or a Magazine article,
as it strikes me, would be a bird's-eye view&mdash;or
rather a bird's-wing flight&mdash;pursuing rapidly the
revolutions of that memorable oracle (for such it
really was to the rest of civilised Europe), which,
through so long a course of years, like the Delphic
oracle to the nations of old, delivered counsels of civil
prudence and of national grandeur, that kept alive
for Christendom the recollections of freedom, and
refreshed to the enslaved Continent the old ideas of
Roman patriotism, which, but for our Parliament,
would have uttered themselves by no voices on earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
That this account of the position occupied by our
British Parliament, in relation to the rest of Europe,
at least after the publication of the Debates had
been commenced by Cave, with the aid of Dr. Johnson,
is, in no respect, romantic or overcharged, may be
learned from the German novels of the last century,
in which we find the British debates as uniformly the
morning accompaniment of breakfast, at the houses
of the rural gentry, &amp;c., as in any English or Scottish
county. Such a sketch would, of course, collect the
characteristics of each age, show in what connection
these characteristics stood with the political aspects
of the time, or with the modes of managing public
business (a fatal rock to our public eloquence in
England!), and illustrate the whole by interesting
specimens from the leading orators in each generation:
from Hampden to Pulteney, amongst oppositionists
or patriots; from Pulteney to O'Connell; or, again,
amongst Ministers, from Hyde to Somers, from Lord
Sunderland to Lords Oxford and Bolingbroke; and
from the plain, downright Sir Robert Walpole, to the
plain, downright Sir Robert Peel.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of this review, the same
'moral,' if one might so call it, would be apparent&mdash;viz.
that in proportion as the oratory was high and
intellectual, did it travel out into the collateral questions
of less instant necessity, but more durable
interest; and that, in proportion as the Grecian
necessity <i>was</i> or was <i>not</i> enforced by the temper of
the House, or by the pressure of public business&mdash;the
necessity which cripples the orator, by confining him
within the severe limits of the case before him&mdash;in
that proportion had or had not the oratory of past<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
generations a surviving interest for modern posterity.
Nothing, in fact, so utterly effete&mdash;not even old law,
or old pharmacy, or old erroneous chemistry&mdash;nothing
so insufferably dull as political orations, unless when
powerfully animated by that spirit of generalisation
which only gives the breath of life and the salt which
preserves from decay, through every age alike. The
very strongest proof, as well as exemplification of all
which has been said on Grecian oratory, may thus be
found in the records of the British senate.</p>

<p>And this, by the way, brings us round to an aspect
of Grecian oratory which has been rendered memorable,
and forced upon our notice, in the shape of a
problem, by the most popular of our native historians&mdash;the
aspect, I mean, of Greek oratory in comparison
with English. Hume has an essay upon the subject;
and the true answer to that essay will open a wide
field of truth to us. In this little paper, Hume
assumes the superiority of Grecian eloquence, as a
thing admitted on all hands, and requiring no proof.
Not the proof of this point did he propose to himself
as his object; not even the illustration of it. No.
All that, Hume held to be superfluous. His object
was, to investigate the causes of this Grecian superiority;
or, if <i>investigate</i> is too pompous a word for so
slight a discussion, more properly, he inquired for the
cause as something that must naturally lie upon the
surface.</p>

<p>What is the answer? First of all, before looking
for causes, a man should be sure of his facts. Now,
as to the main fact at issue, I utterly deny the
superiority of Grecian eloquence. And, first of all, I
change the whole field of inquiry by shifting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
comparison. The Greek oratory is all political or
judicial: we have those also; but the best of our
eloquence, by immeasurable degrees, the noblest and
richest, is our religious eloquence. Here, of course,
all comparison ceases; for classical Grecian religious
eloquence, in Grecian attire, there is none until three
centuries after the Christian era, when we have three
great orators, Gregory Nazianzen, Basil&mdash;of which
two I have a very fixed opinion, having read large
portions of both&mdash;and a third of whom I know nothing.
To our Jeremy Taylor, to our Sir Thomas
Browne, there is no approach made in the Greek
eloquence. The inaugural chapter of the <i>Holy
Dying</i>, to say nothing of many another golden
passage; or the famous passage in the <i>Urn Buriall</i>,
beginning&mdash;'Now, since these bones have rested under
the drums and tramplings of three conquests'&mdash;have
no parallel in literature. The winding up of the
former is more, in its effect, like a great tempestuous
chorus from the <i>Judas Maccabeus</i>, or from Spohr's <i>St.
Paul</i>, than like human eloquence.</p>

<p>But, grant that this transfer of the comparison is
unfair&mdash;still, it is no less unfair to confine the comparison
on our part to the weakest part of our
oratory; but no matter&mdash;let issue be joined even here.
Then we may say, at once, that, for the intellectual
qualities of eloquence, in fineness of understanding, in
depth and in large compass of thought, Burke far
surpasses any orator, ancient or modern. But, if the
comparison were pushed more widely, very certain I
am, that, apart from classical prejudice, no qualities
of just thinking, or fine expression, or even of artificial
ornament, could have been assigned by Hume,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
in which the great body of our deliberative and
forensic orators fall short of Grecian models; though
I will admit, that, by comparison with the Roman
model of Cicero, there is seldom the same artful
prefiguration of the oration throughout its future
course, or the same sustained rhythmus and oratorial
tone. The qualities of art are nowhere so prominently
expressed, nowhere aid the effect so much, as in the
great Roman master.</p>

<p>But, as to Greece, let us now, in one word, unveil
the sole advantage which the eloquence of the Athenian
<i>assembly</i> has over that of the English senate. It is
this&mdash;<i>the public business of Athens was as yet simple
and unencumbered by details</i>; the dignity of the
occasion was scenically sustained. But, in England,
the vast intricacy and complex interweaving of property,
of commerce, of commercial interests, of details
infinite in number, and infinite in littleness, break
down and fritter away into fractions and petty
minuti&aelig;, the whole huge labyrinth of our public
affairs. It is scarcely necessary to explain my meaning.
In Athens, the question before the public
assembly was, peace or war&mdash;before our House of
Commons, perhaps the Exchequer Bills' Bill; at
Athens, a league or no league&mdash;in England, the Tithe
of Agistment Commutation-Bills' Renewal Bill; in
Athens&mdash;shall we forgive a ruined enemy? in England&mdash;shall
we cancel the tax on farthing rushlights? In
short, with us, the infinity of details overlays the
simplicity and grandeur of our public deliberations.</p>

<p>Such was the advantage&mdash;a mighty advantage&mdash;for
Greece. Now, finally, for the use made of this advantage.
To that point I have already spoken. By<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the clamorous and undeliberative qualities of the
Athenian political audience, by its fitful impatience,
and vehement arrogance, and fervid partisanship, all
wide and general discussion was barred <i>in limine</i>.
And thus occurred this singular inversion of positions&mdash;the
greatest of Greek orators was obliged to treat
these Catholic questions as mere Athenian questions
of business. On the other hand, the least eloquent
of British senators, whether from the immense advance
in knowledge, or from the custom and usage of
Parliament, seldom fails, more or less, to elevate his
intense details of pure technical business into something
dignified, either by the necessities of pursuing
the <i>historical</i> relations of the matter in discussion, or
of arguing its merits as a case of general finance, or
as connected with general political economy, or,
perhaps, in its bearings on peace or war. The Grecian
was forced, by the composition of his headstrong
auditory, to degrade and personalise his grand themes;
the Englishman is forced, by the difference of his
audience, by old prescription, and by the opposition
of a well-informed, hostile party, into elevating his
merely technical and petty themes into great national
questions, involving honour and benefit to tens of
millions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="91" id="THE_GERMAN_LANGUAGE_AND"></a>THE GERMAN LANGUAGE, AND PHILOSOPHY OF KANT.</h2>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Using a New Testament, of which (in the narrative
parts at least) any one word being given will suggest
most of what is immediately consecutive, you evade
the most irksome of the penalties annexed to the first
breaking ground in a new language: you evade the
necessity of hunting up and down a dictionary. Your
own memory, and the inevitable suggestions of the
context, furnish a dictionary <i>pro hac vice</i>. And afterwards,
upon advancing to other books, where you are
obliged to forego such aids, and to swim without
corks, you find yourself already in possession of the
particles for expressing addition, succession, exception,
inference&mdash;in short, of all the forms by which
transition or connection is effected (<i>if</i>, <i>but</i>, <i>and</i>, <i>therefore</i>,
<i>however</i>, <i>notwithstanding</i>), together with all those
adverbs for modifying or restraining the extent of a
subject or a predicate, which in all languages alike
compose the essential frame-work or <i>extra-linear</i>
machinery of human thought. The filling-up&mdash;the
<i>matter</i> (in a scholastic sense)&mdash;may differ infinitely;
but the <i>form</i>, the periphery, the determining moulds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
into which this matter is fused&mdash;all this is the same
for ever: and so wonderfully limited in its extent is
this frame-work, so narrow and rapidly revolving is
the clock-work of connections among human thoughts,
that a dozen pages of almost any book suffice to
exhaust all the &#949;&#960;&#949;&#945; &#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#957;&#964;&#945;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> which express them.
To have mastered these &#949;&#960;&#949;&#945; &#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#957;&#964;&#945; is in effect to
have mastered seven-tenths, at the least, of any
language; and the benefit of using a New Testament,
or the familiar parts of an Old Testament, in this preliminary
drill, is, that your own memory is thus made
to operate as a perpetual dictionary or nomenclator.
I have heard Mr. Southey say that, by carrying in
his pocket a Dutch, Swedish, or other Testament, on
occasion of a long journey performed in '<i>muggy</i>'
weather, and in the inside of some venerable 'old
heavy'&mdash;such as used to bestow their tediousness upon
our respectable fathers some thirty or forty years ago&mdash;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
had more than once turned to so valuable an
account the doziness or the dulness of his fellow-travellers,
that whereas he had 'booked' himself at
the coach-office utterly &#945;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#966;&#945;&#946;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;, unacquainted
with the first rudiments of the given language, he
had made his parting bows to his coach brethren
(secretly returning thanks to them for their stupidity),
in a condition for grappling with any common book
in that dialect. One of the polyglot Old or New
Testaments published by Bagster, would be a perfect
Encyclop&aelig;dia, or <i>Panorganon</i>, for such a scheme of
coach discipline, upon dull roads and in dull company.
As respects the German language in particular, I
shall give one caution from my own experience, to the
self-instructor: it is a caution which applies to the
German language exclusively, or to that more than
to any other, because the embarrassment which it is
meant to meet, grows out of a defect of taste characteristic
of the German mind. It is this: elsewhere,
you would naturally, as a beginner, resort to <i>prose</i>
authors, since the license and audacity of poetic thinking,
and the large freedom of a poetic treatment, cannot
fail to superadd difficulties of individual creation to
the general difficulties of a strange dialect. But this
rule, good for every other case, is <i>not</i> good for the
literature of Germany. Difficulties there certainly
are, and perhaps in more than the usual proportion,
from the German peculiarities of poetic treatment;
but even these are overbalanced in the result, by the
single advantage of being limited in the extent by the
metre, or (as it may happen) by the particular stanza.
To German poetry there is a known, fixed, calculable
limit. Infinity, absolute infinity, is impracticable in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
any German metre. Not so with German prose.
Style, in any sense, is an inconceivable idea to a
German intellect. Take the word in the limited sense
of what the Greeks called &#931;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#969;&#957;&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> the
construction of sentences&mdash;I affirm that a German
(unless it were here and there a Lessing) cannot admit
such an idea. Books there are in German, and, in
other respects, very good books too, which consist of
one or two enormous sentences. A German sentence
describes an arch between the rising and the setting
sun. Take Kant for illustration: he has actually
been complimented by the cloud-spinner, Frederic
Schlegel, who is now in Hades, as a most original
artist in the matter of style. 'Original' Heaven
knows he was! His idea of a sentence was as follows:&mdash;We
have all seen, or read of, an old family coach,
and the process of packing it for a journey to London
some seventy or eighty years ago. Night and day,
for a week at least, sate the housekeeper, the lady's
maid, the butler, the gentleman's gentleman, &amp;c.,
packing the huge ark in all its recesses, its 'imperials,'
its 'wills,' its 'Salisbury boots,' its 'sword-cases,' its
front pockets, side pockets, rear pockets, its 'hammer-cloth
cellars' (which a lady explains to me as a corruption
from <i>hamper-cloth</i>, as originally a cloth for hiding
a hamper, stored with <i>viaticum</i>), until all the uses and
needs of man, and of human life, savage or civilised,
were met with separate provision by the infinite chaos.
Pretty nearly upon the model of such an old family
coach packing, did Kant institute and pursue the
packing and stuffing of one of his regular sentences.
Everything that could ever be needed in the way
of explanation, illustration, restraint, inference, by-clause,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
or indirect comment, was to be crammed,
according to this German philosopher's taste, into the
front pockets, side pockets, or rear pockets, of the one
original sentence. Hence it is that a sentence will
last in reading whilst a man</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Might reap an acre of his neighbour's corn.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nor is this any peculiarity of Kant's. It is common
to the whole family of prose writers of Germany,
unless when they happen to have studied French
models, who cultivate the opposite extreme. As a
caution, therefore, practically applied to this particular
anomaly in German prose-writing, I advise all beginners
to choose between two classes of composition&mdash;ballad
poetry, or comedy&mdash;as their earliest school of
exercise; ballad poetry, because the form of the stanza
(usually a quatrain) prescribes a very narrow range
to the sentences; comedy, because the form of dialogue,
and the imitation of daily life in its ordinary tone
of conversation, and the spirit of comedy naturally
suggesting a brisk interchange of speech, all tend to
short sentences. These rules I soon drew from my
own experience and observation. And the one sole
purpose towards which I either sought or wished for
aid, respected the pronunciation; not so much for
attaining a just one (which I was satisfied could not
be realised out of Germany, or, at least, out of a daily
intercourse with Germans) as for preventing the
formation, unawares, of a radically false one. The
guttural and palatine sounds of the <i>ch</i>, and some
other German peculiarities, cannot be acquired without
constant practice. But the false Westphalian or
Jewish pronunciation of the vowels, diphthongs, &amp;c.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
may easily be forestalled, though the true delicacy of
Meissen should happen to be missed. Thus much
guidance I purchased, with a very few guineas, from
my young Dresden tutor, who was most anxious for
permission to extend his assistance; but this I would
not hear of: and, in the spirit of fierce (perhaps
foolish) independence, which governed most of my
actions at that time of life, I did all the rest for
myself.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'It was a banner broad unfurl'd,<br /></span>

<p>These, or words like these, in which Wordsworth
conveys the sudden apocalypse, as by an apparition,
to an ardent and sympathising spirit, of the stupendous
world of America, rising, at once, like an exhalation,
with all its shadowy forests, its endless savannas, and
its pomp of solitary waters&mdash;well and truly might I
have applied to my first launching upon that vast
billowy ocean of the German literature. As a past
literature, as a literature of inheritance and tradition,
the German was nothing. Ancestral titles it had
none; or none comparable to those of England, Spain,
or even Italy; and there, also, it resembled America,
as contrasted with the ancient world of Asia, Europe,
and North Africa.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> But, if its inheritance were
nothing, its prospects, and the scale of its present
development, were in the amplest style of American
grandeur. <i>Ten thousand</i> new books, we are assured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
by Menzel, an author of high reputation&mdash;a <i>literal
myriad</i>&mdash;is considerably below the number annually
poured from all quarters of Germany, into the vast
reservoir of Leipsic; spawn infinite, no doubt, of
crazy dotage, of dreaming imbecility, of wickedness,
of frenzy, through every phasis of Babylonian confusion;
yet, also, teeming and heaving with life and
the instincts of truth&mdash;of truth hunting and chasing
in the broad daylight, or of truth groping in the
chambers of darkness; sometimes seen as it displays
its cornucopia of tropical fruitage; sometimes heard
dimly, and in promise, working its way through
diamond mines. Not the tropics, not the ocean, not
life itself, is such a type of variety, of infinite forms,
or of creative power, as the German literature, in its
recent motions (say for the last twenty years), gathering,
like the Danube, a fresh volume of power at every
stage of its advance. A banner it was, indeed, to me
of miraculous promise, and suddenly unfurled. It
seemed, in those days, an El Dorado as true and undeceiving
as it was evidently inexhaustible. And the
central object in this interminable wilderness of what
then seemed imperishable bloom and verdure&mdash;the
very tree of knowledge in the midst of this Eden&mdash;was
the new or transcendental philosophy of Immanuel
Kant.</p>

<p>I have described the gorgeousness of my expectations
in those early days of my prelusive acquaintance
with German literature. I have a little lingered in
painting that glad aurora of my first pilgrimage to
the fountains of the Rhine and of the Danube, in
order adequately to shadow out the gloom and blight
which soon afterwards settled upon the hopes of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
golden dawn. In Kant, I had been taught to believe,
were the keys of a new and a creative philosophy.
Either '<i>ejus ductu</i>,' or '<i>ejus auspiciis</i>'&mdash;that is, either
directly under his guidance, or indirectly under any
influence remotely derived from his principles&mdash;I
looked confidingly to see the great vistas and avenues
of truth laid open to the philosophic inquirer. Alas!
all was a dream. Six weeks' study was sufficient to
close my hopes in that quarter for ever. The philosophy
of Kant&mdash;so famous, so commanding in
Germany, from about the period of the French
Revolution&mdash;already, in 1805, I had found to be a
philosophy of destruction, and scarcely, in any one
chapter, so much as <i>tending</i> to a philosophy of reconstruction.
It destroys by wholesale, and it substitutes
nothing. Perhaps, in the whole history of man, it is
an unexampled case, that such a scheme of speculation&mdash;which
offers nothing seducing to human aspirations,
nothing splendid to the human imagination, nothing
even positive and affirmative to the human understanding&mdash;should
have been able to found an interest
so broad and deep among thirty-five millions of cultivated
men. The English reader who supposes this
interest to have been confined to academic bowers, or
the halls of philosophic societies, is most inadequately
alive to the case. Sects, heresies, schisms, by hundreds,
have arisen out of this philosophy&mdash;many thousands
of books have been written by way of teaching it,
discussing it, extending it, opposing it. And yet it
is a fact, that all its doctrines are negative&mdash;teaching,
in no case, what we <i>are</i>, but simply what we are <i>not</i>
to believe&mdash;and that all its truths are barren. Such
being its unpopular character, I cannot but imagine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
that the German people have received it with so much
ardour, from profound incomprehension of its meaning,
and utter blindness to its drift&mdash;a solution which
may seem extravagant, but is not so; for, even
amongst those who have expressly commented on this
philosophy, not one of the many hundreds whom I
have myself read, but has retracted from every attempt
to explain its dark places. In these dark places lies,
indeed, the secret of its attraction. Were light poured
into them, it would be seen that they are <i>culs-de-sac</i>,
passages that lead to nothing; but, so long as they
continue dark, it is not known whither they lead, how
far, in what direction, and whether, in fact, they may
not issue into paths connected directly with the
positive and the infinite. Were it known that upon
every path a barrier faces you insurmountable to
human steps&mdash;like the barriers which fence in the
Abyssinian valley of Rasselas&mdash;the popularity of this
philosophy would expire at once; for no popular
interest can long be sustained by speculations which,
in every aspect, are known to be essentially negative
and essentially finite. Man's nature has something
of infinity within itself, which requires a corresponding
infinity in its objects. We are told, indeed, by
Mr. Bulwer, that the Kantian system has ceased to
be of any authority in Germany&mdash;that it is defunct,
in fact&mdash;and that we have first begun to import it
into England, after its root had withered, or begun
to wither, in its native soil. But Mr. Bulwer is
mistaken. The philosophy has never withered in
Germany. It cannot even be said that its fortunes
have retrograded: they have oscillated: accidents of
taste and ability in particular professors, or caprices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of fashion, have given a momentary fluctuation to
this or that new form of Kantianism,&mdash;an ascendency,
for a period, to various, and, in some respects, conflicting,
modifications of the transcendental system;
but all alike have derived their power mediately from
Kant. No weapons, even if employed as hostile
weapons, are now forged in any armoury but that of
Kant; and, to repeat a Roman figure which I used
above, all the modern polemic tactics of what is called
metaphysics, are trained and made to move either
<i>ejus ductu</i> or <i>ejus auspiciis</i>. Not one of the new
systems affects to call back the Leibnitzian philosophy,
the Cartesian, or any other of earlier or later date, as
adequate to the purposes of the intellect in this day,
or as capable of yielding even a sufficient terminology.
Let this last fact decide the question of Kant's
vitality. <i>Qui bene distinguit bene docet.</i> This is an
old adage. Now, he who imposes new names upon
all the acts, the functions, and the objects of the
philosophic understanding, must be presumed to have
distinguished most sharply, and to have ascertained
with most precision, their general relations&mdash;<i>so long
as his terminology continues to be adopted</i>. This test,
applied to Kant, will show that his spirit yet survives
in Germany. Frederic Schlegel, it is true, twenty
years ago, in his lectures upon literature, assures us
that even the disciples of the great philosopher have
agreed to abandon his philosophic nomenclature. But
the German philosophic literature, since that date,
tells another tale. Mr. Bulwer is, therefore, wrong;
and, without going to Germany, looking only to
France, he will see cause to revise his sentence.
Cousin&mdash;the philosophic Cousin, the only great name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
in philosophy for modern France&mdash;familiar as he is
with North Germany, can hardly be presumed unacquainted
with a fact so striking, if it <i>were</i> a fact,
as the extinction of a system once so triumphantly
supreme as that of Kant; and yet Mr. Bulwer,
admiring Cousin as he does, cannot but have noticed
his efforts to naturalise Kant in France. Meantime,
if it were even true that transcendentalism had lost
its hold of the public mind in Germany, <i>prim&acirc; facie</i>,
this would prove little more than the fickleness of
that public which must have been wrong in one of
the two cases&mdash;either when adopting the system, or
when rejecting it. Whatever there may be of truth
and value in the system, will remain unimpeached by
such caprices, whether of an individual or of a great
nation; and England would still be in the right to
import the philosophy, however late in the day, if it
were true even (which I doubt greatly) that she <i>is</i>
importing it.</p>

<p>Both truth and value there certainly <i>is</i> in one part
of the Kantian philosophy; and that part is its
foundation. I had intended, at this point, to introduce
an outline of the transcendental philosophy&mdash;not,
perhaps, as entering by logical claim of right
into any biographical sketch, but as a very allowable
digression in the record of that man's life to whom,
in the way of hope and of profound disappointment,
it had been so memorable an object. For two or
three years before I mastered the language of Kant,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
it had been a pole-star to my hopes, and <i>in hypothesi</i>
agreeably to the uncertain plans of uncertain knowledge,
the luminous guide to my future life&mdash;as a life
dedicated and set apart to philosophy. Such it was
some years <i>before</i> I knew it: for, at least ten long
years <i>after</i> I came into a condition of valueing its true
pretensions and measuring its capacities, this same
philosophy shed the gloom of something like misanthropy
upon my views and estimates of human nature;
for man was an abject animal, if the limitations which
Kant assigned to the motions of his speculative
reason were as absolute and hopeless as, under <i>his</i>
scheme of the understanding and <i>his</i> genesis of its
powers, too evidently they were. I belonged to a
reptile race, if the wings by which we had sometimes
<i>seemed</i> to mount, and the buoyancy which had <i>seemed</i>
to support our flight, were indeed the fantastic delusions
which he represented them. Such, and so deep
and so abiding in its influence upon my life, having
been the influence of this German philosophy, according
to all logic of proportions, in selecting the objects
of my notice, I might be excused for setting before
the reader, in its full array, the analysis of its capital
sections. However, in any memorial of a life which
professes to keep in view (though but as a secondary
purpose) any regard to popular taste, the logic of
proportions must bend, after all, to the law of the
occasion&mdash;to the proprieties of time and place. For
the present, therefore, I shall restrict myself to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>few sentences in which it may be proper to gratify
the curiosity of <i>some</i> readers, the two or three in a
hundred, as to the peculiar distinctions of this philosophy.
Even to these two or three out of each
hundred, I shall not venture to ascribe a larger
curiosity than with respect to the most general
'whereabouts' of its position&mdash;from what point it
starts&mdash;whence and from what aspect it surveys the
ground&mdash;and by what links from this starting-point
it contrives to connect itself with the main objects of
philosophic inquiry.</p>

<p>Immanuel Kant was originally a dogmatist in the
school of Leibnitz and Wolf; that is, according to
his trisection of all philosophy into dogmatic, sceptical,
and critical, he was, upon all questions, disposed to a
strong <i>affirmative</i> creed, without courting any particular
examination into the grounds of this creed, or
into its assailable points. From this slumber, as it
is called by himself, he was suddenly aroused by the
Humian doctrine of cause and effect. This celebrated
essay on the nature of necessary connection&mdash;so
thoroughly misapprehended at the date of its first
publication to the world by its <i>soi-disant</i> opponents,
Oswald, Beattie, &amp;c., and so imperfectly comprehended
since then by various <i>soi-disant</i> defenders&mdash;became in
effect the 'occasional cause' (in the phrase of the
logicians) of the entire subsequent philosophic scheme
of Kant&mdash;every section of which arose upon the
accidental opening made to analogical trains of
thought, by this memorable effort of scepticism,
applied by Hume to one capital phenomenon among
the necessities of the human understanding. What
is the nature of Hume's scepticism as applied to this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>phenomenon? What is the main thesis of his celebrated
essay on cause and effect? For few, indeed,
are they who really know anything about it. If a
man really understands it, a very few words will avail
to explain the <i>nodus</i>. Let us try. It is a necessity
of the <i>human</i> understanding (very probably not a
necessity of a higher order of intelligences) to connect
its experiences by means of the idea of <i>cause</i> and its
correlate, <i>effect</i>: and when Beattie, Oswald, Reid, &amp;c.
were exhausting themselves in proofs of the indispensableness
of this idea, they were fighting with shadows;
for no man had ever questioned the practical necessity
for such an idea to the coherency of human thinking.
Not the practical necessity, but the internal consistency
of this notion, and the original right to such
a notion, was the point of inquisition. For, attend,
courteous reader, and three separate propositions will
set before your eyes the difficulty. <i>First Prop.</i>, which,
for the sake of greater precision, permit me to throw
into Latin:&mdash;<i>Non datur aliquid</i> [A] <i>quo posito ponitur
aliud</i> [B] <i>&agrave; priori</i>; that is, in other words, You
cannot lay your hands upon that one object or phenomenon
[A] in the whole circle of natural existences,
which, being assumed, will entitle you to assume <i>&agrave;
priori</i>, any other object whatsoever [B] as succeeding
it. You could not, I say, of any object or phenomenon
whatever, assume this succession <i>&agrave; priori</i>&mdash;that is,
<i>previously to experience</i>. <i>Second Prop.</i> But, if the succession
of B to A be made known to you, not <i>&agrave; priori</i>
(by the involution of B in the idea of A), but by
experience, then you cannot ascribe <i>necessity</i> to the
succession: the connection between them is not
necessary but contingent. For the very widest experience&mdash;an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>experience which should stretch over all
ages, from the beginning to the end of time&mdash;can
never establish a <i>nexus</i> having the least approximation
to necessity; no more than a rope of sand could gain
the cohesion of adamant, by repeating its links through
a billion of successions. <i>Prop. Third.</i> Hence (<i>i. e.</i>
from the two preceding propositions), it appears that
no instance or case of <i>nexus</i> that ever can have been
offered to the notice of any human understanding,
has in it, or, by possibility, could have had anything
of necessity. Had the <i>nexus</i> been necessary, you
would have seen it beforehand; whereas, by Prop. I.
<i>Non datur aliquid, quo posito ponitur aliud &agrave; priori.</i>
This being so, now comes the startling fact, that the
notion of a <i>cause</i> includes the notion of necessity.
For, if A (the cause) be connected with B (the effect)
only in a casual or accidental way, you do not feel
warranted in calling it a cause. If heat applied to
ice (A) were sometimes followed by a tendency to
liquefaction (B) and sometimes not, you would not
consider A connected with B as a cause, but only as
some variable accompaniment of the true and unknown
cause, which might allowably be present or be absent.
This, then, is the startling and mysterious phenomenon
of the human understanding&mdash;that, in a certain
notion, which is indispensable to the coherency of our
whole experience, indispensable to the establishing
any <i>nexus</i> between the different parts and successions
of our whole train of notices, we include an accessary
notion of necessity, which yet has no justification or
warrant, no assignable derivation from any known
or possible case of human experience. We have
one idea at least&mdash;viz. the idea of causation&mdash;which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>transcends our possible experience by one important
element, the element of <i>necessity</i>, that never can have
been derived from the only source of ideas recognised
by the philosophy of this day. A Lockian never can
find his way out of this dilemma. The experience
(whether it be the experience of sensation or the
experience of reflection) which he adopts for his
master-key, never will unlock this case; for the sum
total of human experience, collected from all ages, can
avail only to tell us what <i>is</i>, but never what <i>must be</i>.
The idea of necessity is absolutely transcendant to
experience, <i>per se</i>, and must be derived from some
other source. From what source? Could Hume tell
us? No: he, who had started the game so acutely
(for with every allowance for the detection made in
Thomas Aquinas, of the original suggestion, as recorded
in the <i>Biographia Literaria</i> of Coleridge, we
must still allow great merit of a secondary kind to
Hume for his modern revival and restatement of the
doctrine), this same acute philosopher broke down
confessedly in his attempt to hunt the game down.
His solution is worthless.</p>

<p>Kant, however, having caught the original scent
from Hume, was more fortunate. He saw, at a
glance, that here was a test applied to the Lockian
philosophy, which showed, at the very least, its <i>insufficiency</i>.
If it were good even for so much as it
explained&mdash;which Burke is disposed to receive as a
sufficient warrant for the favourable reception of a
new hypothesis&mdash;at any rate, it now appeared that
there was something which it could <i>not</i> explain. But
next, Kant took a large step in advance <i>proprio morte</i>.
Reflecting upon the one idea adduced by Hume, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>transcending the ordinary source of ideas, he began
to ask himself, whether it were likely that this idea
should stand alone? Were there not other ideas in
the same predicament; other ideas including the
same element of necessity, and, therefore, equally
disowning the parentage assigned by Locke? Upon
investigation, he found that there were: he found
that there were eleven others in exactly the same
circumstances. The entire twelve he denominated
categories; and the mode by which he ascertained
their number&mdash;that there were so many and no more&mdash;is
of itself so remarkable as to merit notice in the
most superficial sketch. But, in fact, this one explanation
will put the reader in possession of Kant's
system, so far as he could understand it without an
express and toilsome study. With this explanation,
therefore, of the famous categories, I shall close my
slight sketch of the system. Has the reader ever
considered the meaning of the term <i>Category</i>&mdash;a term
so ancient and so venerable from its connection with
the most domineering philosophy that has yet appeared
amongst men? The doctrine of the Categories
(or, in its Roman appellation, of the <i>Predicaments</i>), is
one of the few wrecks from the Peripatetic philosophy
which still survives as a doctrine taught by public
authority in the most ancient academic institutions of
Europe. It continues to form a section in the code
of public instruction; and perhaps under favour of
a pure accident. For though, strictly speaking, a
<i>metaphysical</i> speculation, it has always been prefixed
as a sort of preface to the <i>Organon</i> (or <i>logical</i> treatises)
of Aristotle, and has thus accidentally shared in the
immortality conceded to that most perfect of human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>works. Far enough were the Categories from meriting
such distinction. Kant was well aware of this: he
was aware that the Aristotelian Categories were a
useless piece of scholastic lumber: unsound in their
first conception; and, though illustrated through long
centuries by the schoolmen, and by still earlier
Grecian philosophers, never in any one known instance
turned to a profitable account. Why, then, being
aware that even in idea they were false, besides being
practically unsuitable, did Kant adopt or borrow a
name laden with this superfetation of reproach&mdash;all
that is false in theory superadded to all that is useless
in practice? He did so for a remarkable reason: he
felt, according to his own explanation, that Aristotle
had been <i>groping</i> [the German word expressive of his
blind procedure is <i>herumtappen</i>]&mdash;groping in the dark,
but under a semi-conscious instinct of truth. Here
is a most remarkable case or situation of the human
intellect, happening alike to individuals and to entire
generations&mdash;in the situation of yearning or craving,
as it were, for a great idea as yet unknown, but dimly
and uneasily prefigured. Sometimes the very brink,
as it may be called, of such an idea is approached;
sometimes it is even imperfectly discovered; but with
marks in the very midst of its imperfections, which
serve as indications to a person coming better armed
for ascertaining the sub-conscious thought which had
governed their tentative motions. As it stands in
Aristotle's scheme, the idea of a category is a mere
lifeless abstraction. Rising through a succession of
species to genera, and from these to still higher
genera, you arrive finally at a highest genus&mdash;a naked
abstraction, beyond which no further regress is possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
This highest genus, this <i>genus generalissimum</i>,
is, in peripatetic language, a category; and no purpose
or use has ever been assigned to any one of these
categories, of which ten were enumerated at first,
beyond that of classification&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> a purpose of mere
convenience. Even for as trivial a purpose as this,
it gave room for suspecting a failure, when it was
afterwards found that the original ten categories did
not exhaust the possibilities of the case; that other
supplementary categories (<i>post-pr&aelig;dicamenti</i>) became
necessary. And, perhaps, 'more last words' might
even yet be added, supplementary supplements, and
so forth, by a hair-splitting intellect. Failures as
gross as these, revisals still open to revision, and
amendments calling for amendments, were at once a
broad confession that here there was no falling in
with any great law of nature. The paths of nature
may sometimes be arrived at in a tentative way; but
they are broad and determinate; and, when found,
vindicate themselves. Still, in all this erroneous
subtilisation, and these abortive efforts, Kant perceived
a grasping at some real idea&mdash;fugitive indeed
and coy, which had for the present absolutely escaped;
but he caught glimpses of it continually in the rear;
he felt its necessity to any account of the human
understanding that could be satisfactory to one who
had meditated on Locke's theory as probed and
searched by Leibnitz. And in this uneasy state&mdash;half
sceptical, half creative, rejecting and substituting,
pulling down and building up&mdash;what was in sum and
finally the course which he took for bringing his
trials and essays to a crisis? He states this himself,
somewhere in the Introduction to his <i>Critik der reinen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Vernunft</i>; and the passage is a memorable one.
Fifteen years at the least have passed since I read it;
and, therefore, I cannot pretend to produce the words;
but the substance I shall give; and I appeal to the
candour of all his readers, whether they have been
able to apprehend his meaning. I certainly did not
for years. But, now that I do, the passage places
his procedure in a most striking and edifying light.
Astronomers, says Kant, had gone on for ages, assuming
that the earth was the central body of our
system; and insuperable were the difficulties which
attended that assumption. At length, it occurred to
try what would result from inverting the assumption.
Let the earth, instead of offering a fixed centre for
the revolving motions of other heavenly bodies, be
supposed itself to revolve about some one of these, as
the sun. That supposition was tried, and gradually
all the phenomena which, before, had been incoherent,
anomalous, or contradictory, began to express themselves
as parts of a most harmonious system. 'Something,'
he goes on to say, 'analogous to this I have
practised with regard to the subject of my inquiry&mdash;the
human understanding. All others had sought
their central principle of the intellectual phenomena
out of the understanding, in something external to
the mind. I first turned my inquiries upon the mind
itself. I first applied my examination to the very
analysis of the understanding.' In words, not precisely
these, but pretty nearly equivalent to them,
does Kant state, by contradistinction, the value and
the nature of his own procedure. He first, according
to his own representation, thought of applying his
investigation to the mind itself. Here was a passage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>which for years (I may say) continued to stagger and
confound me. What! he, Kant, in the latter end of
the 18th century, about the year 1787&mdash;he the first
who had investigated the mind! This was not arrogance
so much as it was insanity. Had he said&mdash;I,
first, upon just principles, or with a fortunate result,
investigated the human understanding, he would have
said no more than every fresh theorist is bound to
suppose, as his preliminary apology for claiming the
attention of a busy world. Indeed, if a writer, on
any part of knowledge, does <i>not</i> hold himself superior
to all his predecessors, we are entitled to say&mdash;Then,
why do you presume to trouble us? It may <i>look</i> like
modesty, but <i>is</i>, in effect, downright effrontery for
you to think yourself no better than other critics;
you were at liberty to think so whilst no claimant of
public notice&mdash;as being so, it is most arrogant in you
to be modest. This would be the criticism applied
justly to a man who, in Kant's situation, as the author
of a new system, should use a language of unseasonable
modesty or deprecation. To have spoken boldly
of himself was a duty; we could not tolerate his doing
otherwise. But to speak of himself in the exclusive
terms I have described, does certainly seem, and for
years did seem to myself, little short of insanity. Of
this I am sure that no student of Kant, having the
passage before him, can have known heretofore what
consistent, what rational interpretation to give it;
and, in candour, he ought to own himself my debtor
for the light he will now receive. Yet, so easy is it
to imagine, after a meaning is once pointed out, and
the station given from which it shows itself <i>as</i> the
meaning&mdash;so easy, under these circumstances, is it to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>imagine that one has, or that one could have, found
it for one's self&mdash;that I have little expectation of
reaping much gratitude for my explanation. I say
this, not as of much importance one way or the other
in a single case of the kind, but because a general
consideration of this nature has sometimes operated
to make me more indifferent or careless as to the
publication of commentaries on difficult systems, when
I had found myself able to throw much light on the
difficulties. The very success with which I should
have accomplished the task&mdash;the perfect removal of
the obstacles in the student's path&mdash;were the very
grounds of my assurance-that the service would be
little valued. For I have found what it was occasionally,
in conversation, to be too luminous&mdash;to have
explained, for instance, too clearly a dark place in
Ricardo. In such a case, I have known a man of the
very greatest powers, mistake the intellectual effort
he had put forth to apprehend my elucidation, and to
meet it half way, for his own unassisted conquest over
the difficulties; and, within an hour or two after, I
have had, perhaps, to stand, as an attack upon myself,
arguments entirely and recently furnished by myself.
No case is more possible: even to apprehend a complex
explanation, a man cannot be passive; he must exert
considerable energy of mind; and, in the fresh consciousness
of this energy, it is the most natural mistake
in the world for him to feel the argument which he
has, by considerable effort, appropriated to be an
argument which he has originated. Kant is the most
unhappy champion of his own doctrines, the most
infelicitous expounder of his own meaning, that has
ever existed. Neither has any other commentator
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>succeeded in throwing a moonlight radiance upon his
philosophy. Yet certain I am, that, were I, or any
man, to disperse all his darkness, exactly in that
proportion in which we did so&mdash;exactly in the proportion
in which we smoothed all hindrances&mdash;exactly in
that proportion would it cease to be known or felt
that there had ever been any hindrances to be
smoothed. This, however, is digression, to which I
have been tempted by the interesting nature of the
grievance. In a jesting way, this grievance is obliquely
noticed in the celebrated couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Had you seen but these roads before they were made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'd lift up your hands and bless Marshal Wade.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The pleasant bull here committed conceals a most
melancholy truth, and one of large extent. Innumerable
are the services to truth, to justice, or society,
which never <i>can</i> be adequately valued by those who
reap their benefits, simply because the transition from
the early and bad state to the final or improved state
cannot be retraced or kept alive before the eyes. The
record perishes. The last point gained is seen; but
the starting-point, the points <i>from</i> which it was gained,
is forgotten. And the traveller never <i>can</i> know the
true amount of his obligations to Marshal Wade,
because, though seeing the roads which the Marshal
has created, he can only guess at those which he
superseded. Now, returning to this impenetrable
passage of Kant, I will briefly inform the reader that
he may read it into sense by connecting it with a part
of Kant's system, from which it is in his own delivery
entirely dislocated. Going forwards some thirty or
forty pages, he will find Kant's development of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>own categories. And, by placing in juxtaposition
with that development this blind sentence, he will
find a reciprocal light arising. All philosophers,
worthy of that name, have found it necessary to
allow of some great cardinal ideas that transcended
all the Lockian origination&mdash;ideas that were larger in
their compass than any possible notices of sense or
any reflex notices of the understanding; and those
who have denied such ideas, will be found invariably
to have supported their denial by a <i>vitium subreptionis</i>,
and to have deduced their pretended genealogies of
such ideas by means of a <i>petitio principii</i>&mdash;silently
and stealthily putting <i>into</i> some step of their <i>leger-de-main</i>
process everything that they would pretend to
have extracted <i>from</i> it. But, previously to Kant,
it is certain that all philosophers had left the origin
of these higher or transcendent ideas unexplained.
Whence came they? In the systems to which, Locke
replies, they had been called <i>innate</i> or <i>connate</i>. These
were the Cartesian systems. Cudworth, again, who
maintained certain '<i>immutable ideas</i>' of morality,
had said nothing about their origin; and Plato had
supposed them to be reminiscences from some higher
mode of existence. Kant first attempted to assign
them an origin within the mind itself, though not in
any Lockian fashion of reflection upon sensible impressions.
And this is doubtless what he means by
saying that he first had investigated the mind&mdash;that
is, he first for such a purpose.</p>

<p>Where, then, is it, in what act or function of the
mind, that Kant finds the matrix of these transcendent
ideas? Simply in the logical forms of the
understanding. Every power exerts its agency under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>some <i>laws</i>&mdash;that is, in the language of Kant, by
certain <i>forms</i>. We leap by certain laws&mdash;viz. of
equilibrium, of muscular motion, of gravitation. We
dance by certain laws. So also we reason by certain
laws. These laws, or <i>formal</i> principles, under a
particular condition, become the categories.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a short derivation, in a very few
words, of those ideas transcending sense, which all
philosophy, the earliest, has been unable to dispense
with, and yet none could account for. Thus, for
example, every act of reasoning must, in the first
place, express itself in distinct propositions; that is,
in such as contain a subject (or that concerning which
you affirm or deny something), a predicate (that which
you affirm or deny), and a copula, which connects
them. These propositions must have what is technically
called, in logic, a certain <i>quantity</i>, or compass
(viz. must be universal, particular, or singular); and
again they must have what is called <i>quality</i> (that is,
must be affirmative, or negative, or infinite): and
thus arises a ground for certain corresponding ideas,
which are Kant's categories of quantity and quality.</p>

<p>But, to take an illustration more appropriately from
the very idea which first aroused Kant to the sense of
a vast hiatus in the received philosophies&mdash;the idea of
<i>cause</i>, which had been thrown as an apple of discord
amongst the schools, by Hume. How did Kant
deduce this? Simply thus: it is a doctrine of universal
logic, that there are three varieties of syllogism&mdash;viz.
1st, Categoric, or directly declarative [<i>A is B</i>];
2nd, Hypothetic, or conditionally declarative [<i>If C is
D, then A is B</i>]; 3rd, Disjunctive, or declarative, by
means of a choice which exhausts the possible cases<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
[<i>A is either B, or C, or D; but not C or D; ergo B</i>].
Now, the idea of <i>causation</i>, or, in Kant's language,
the category of Cause and Effect, is deduced immediately,
and most naturally, as the reader will acknowledge
on examination, from the 2nd or hypothetic form
of syllogism, when the relation of dependency is the
same as in the idea of causation, and the <i>necessary</i>
connection a direct type of that which takes place
between a cause and its effect.</p>

<p>Thus, then, without going one step further, the
reader will find grounds enough for reflection and for
reverence towards Kant in these two great results:
1st, That an order of ideas has been established, which
all deep philosophy has demanded, even when it could
not make good its claim. This postulate is fulfilled.
2ndly, The postulate is fulfilled without mysticism or
Platonic reveries. Ideas, however indispensable to
human needs, and even to the connection of our
thoughts, which came to us from nobody knew whence,
must for ever have been suspicious; and, as in the
memorable instance cited from Hume, must have been
liable for ever to a question of validity. But, deduced
as they now are from a matrix within our own minds,
they cannot reasonably fear any assaults of scepticism.</p>

<p>Here I shall stop. A reader new to these inquiries
may think all this a trifle. But he who reflects a
little, will see that, even thus far, and going no step
beyond this point, the Kantian doctrine of the Categories
answers a standing question hanging aloof as a
challenge to human philosophy, fills up a <i>lacuna</i>
pointed out from the era of Plato. It solves a problem
which has startled and perplexed every age:
viz. this&mdash;that man is in possession, nay, in the hourly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>exercise, of ideas larger than he can show any title to.
And in another way, the reader may measure the
extent of this doctrine, by reflecting that, even so far
as now stated, it is precisely coextensive with the
famous scheme of Locke. For what is the capital
thesis of that scheme? Simply this&mdash;that all necessity
for supposing immediate impressions made upon our
understandings by God, or other supernatural, or
antenatal, or connatal, agencies, is idle and romantic;
for that, upon examining the furniture of our minds,
nothing will be found there which cannot adequately
be explained out of our daily experience; and, until
we find something that cannot be solved by this
explanation, it is childish to go in quest of higher
causes. Thus says Locke: and his whole work, upon
its first plan, is no more than a continual pleading of
this single thesis, pursuing it through all the plausible
objections. Being, therefore, as large in its extent as
Locke, the reader must not complain of the transcendental
scheme as too narrow, even in that limited
section of it here brought under his notice.</p>

<p>For the purpose of repelling it, he must do one of
two things: either he must show that these categories
or transcendent notions are not susceptible of the
derivation and genesis here assigned to them&mdash;that
is, from the forms of the <i>logos</i> or formal understanding;
or, if content to abide by that derivation, he
must allege that there are other categories besides
those enumerated, and unprovided with any similar
parentage.</p>

<p>Thus much in reply to him who complains of the
doctrine here stated; as, 1st, Too narrow; or, 2nd, As
insufficiently established. But, 3rd, in reply to him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>who wishes to see it further pursued or applied, I say
that the possible applications are perhaps infinite.
With respect to those made by Kant himself, they
are chiefly contained in his main and elementary
work, the <i>Critik der reinen Vernunft</i>; and they are of
a nature to make any man melancholy. Indeed, let
a man consider merely this one notion of <i>causation</i>;
let him reflect on its origin; let him remember that,
agreeably to this origin, it follows that we have no
right to view anything <i>in rerum natur&acirc;</i> as objectively,
or in itself a cause; that when, upon the fullest
philosophic proof, we call A the cause of B, we do in
fact only subsume A under the notion of a cause; we
invest it with that function under that relation, that
the whole proceeding is merely with respect to a
<i>human</i> understanding, and by way of indispensable
<i>nexus</i> to the several parts of our experience; finally,
that there is the greatest reason to doubt, whether
the idea of <i>causation</i> is at all applicable to any other
world than this, or any other than a human experience.
Let a man meditate but a little on this or
other aspects of this transcendental philosophy, and
he will find the steadfast earth itself rocking as it
were beneath his feet; a world about him, which is
in some sense a world of deception; and a world
before him, which seems to promise a world of confusion,
or '<i>a world not realised</i>.' All this he might
deduce for himself without further aid from Kant.
However, the particular purposes to which Kant
applies his philosophy, from the difficulties which
beset them, are unfitted for anything below a regular
treatise. Suffice it to say here, that, difficult as these
speculations are from one or two embarrassing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>doctrines on the Transcendental Consciousness, and
depressing as they are from their general tendency,
they are yet painfully irritating to the curiosity, and
especially so from a sort of <i>experimentum crucis</i>, which
they yield in the progress of their development on
behalf of the entire doctrine of Kant&mdash;a test which,
up to this hour, has offered defiance to any hostile
hand. The test or defiance which I speak of, takes
the shape of certain <i>antinomies</i> (so they are termed),
severe adamantine arguments, affirmative and negative,
on two or three celebrated problems, with no
appeal to any possible decision, but one, which involves
the Kantian doctrines. A <i>qu&aelig;stio vexata</i> is proposed&mdash;for
instance, the <i>infinite divisibility of matter</i>; each
side of this question, <i>thesis</i> and <i>antithesis</i>, is argued;
the logic is irresistible, the links are perfect, and for
each side alternately there is a verdict, thus terminating
in the most triumphant <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>&mdash;viz.
that A, at one and the same time and in the
same sense, is and is not B, from which no escape is
available, but through a Kantian solution. On any
other philosophy, it is demonstrated that this opprobrium
of the human understanding, this scandal of
logic, cannot be removed. This celebrated chapter of
<i>antinomies</i> has been of great service to the mere
polemics of the transcendental philosophy: it is a
glove or gage of defiance, constantly lying on the
ground, challenging the rights of victory and supremacy
so long as it is <i>not</i> taken up by any antagonist,
and bringing matters to a short decision when it <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>One section, and that the introductory section,
of the transcendental philosophy, I have purposely
omitted, though in strictness not to be insulated or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>dislocated from the faithful exposition even of that
which I have given. It is the doctrine of Space and
Time. These profound themes, so confounding to the
human understanding, are treated by Kant under two
aspects&mdash;1st, as Anchauungen, or <i>Intuitions</i> (so the
German word is usually translated for want of a
better); 2ndly, as forms, <i>&agrave; priori</i>, of all our other
intuitions. Often have I laughed internally at the
characteristic exposure of Kant's style of thinking&mdash;that
he, a man of so much worldly sagacity, could
think of offering, and of the German scholastic habits,
that any modern nation could think of accepting
such cabalistical phrases, such a true and very
'<i>Ignotium per Ignotius</i>,' in part payment of an explanatory
account of Time and Space. Kant repeats
these words&mdash;as a charm before which all darkness
flies; and he supposes continually the case of a man
denying his explanations or demanding proofs of them,
never once the sole imaginable case&mdash;viz. of all men
demanding an explanation of these explanations.
Deny them! Combat them! How should a man
deny, why should he combat, what might, for anything
to the contrary appearing, contain a promissory
note at two months after date for 100 guineas? No;
it will cost a little preliminary work before <i>such</i>
explanations will much avail any scheme of philosophy,
either for the <i>pro</i> or the <i>con</i>. And yet I do myself
really profess to understand the dark words; and a
great service it would be to sound philosophy amongst
us, if this one word <i>anschauung</i> were adequately
unfolded and naturalised (as naturalised it might be)
in the English philosophic dictionary, by some full
Grecian equivalent. Strange that no man acquainted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>with German philosophy, should yet have been struck
by the fact&mdash;or, being struck, should not have felt it
important to call public attention to the fact of our
inevitable feebleness in a branch of study for which
as yet we want the indispensable words. Our feebleness
is at once argued by this want, and partly caused.
Meantime, as respects the Kantian way of viewing
space, by much the most important innovation which
it makes upon the old doctrines is&mdash;that it considers
space as a <i>subjective</i> not an <i>objective</i> aliquid; that is,
as having its whole available foundation lying ultimately
in ourselves, not in any external or alien
tenure. This one distinction, as applied to space, for
ever secures (what nothing else <i>can</i> secure or explain)
the cogency of geometrical evidence. Whatever is
true for any determinations of a space originally
included in ourselves, must be true for such determinations
for ever, since they cannot become objects
of consciousness to us but in and by that very mode
of conceiving space, that very form of schematism
which originally presented us with these determinations
of space, or any whatever. In the uniformity
of our own space-conceiving faculty, we have a pledge
of the absolute and <i>necessary</i> uniformity (or internal
agreement among themselves) of all future or possible
determinations of space; because they could not otherwise
become to us conceivable forms of space, than
by adapting themselves to the known conditions of
our conceiving faculty. Here we have the <i>necessity</i>
which is indispensable to all geometrical demonstration:
it is a necessity founded in our human organ,
which cannot admit or conceive a space, unless as
preconforming to these original forms or schematisms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Whereas, on the contrary, if space were something
<i>objective</i>, and consequently being a separate existence,
independent of a human organ, then it is altogether
impossible to find any intelligible source of <i>obligation</i>
or cogency in the evidence&mdash;such as is indispensable
to the very nature of geometrical demonstration.
Thus we will suppose that a regular demonstration
has gradually, from step to step downwards, through
a series of propositions&mdash;No. 8 resting upon 7, that
upon 5, 5 upon 3&mdash;at length reduced you to the
elementary axiom, that Two straight lines cannot
enclose a space. Now, if space be <i>subjective</i> originally&mdash;that
is to say, founded (as respects us and our
geometry) in ourselves&mdash;then it is impossible that two
such lines can enclose a space, because the possibility
of anything whatever relating to the determinations
of space is exactly co-extensive with (and exactly
expressed by) our power to conceive it. Being thus
able to affirm its impossibility universally, we can
build a demonstration upon it. But, on the other
hypothesis, of space being <i>objective</i>, it is impossible to
guess whence we are to draw our proof of the alleged
inaptitude in two straight lines for enclosing a space.
The most we could say is, that hitherto no instance
has been found of an enclosed space circumscribed by
two straight lines. It would not do to allege our
human inability to conceive, or in imagination to
draw, such a circumscription. For, besides that such
a mode of argument is exactly the one supposed to
have been rejected, it is liable to this unanswerable
objection, so long as space is assumed to have an
<i>objective</i> existence, viz. that the human inability to
conceive such a possibility, only argues (what in fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>is often found in other cases) that the <i>objective</i> existence
of space&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> the existence of space in itself, and
in its absolute nature&mdash;is far larger than its subjective
existence&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> than its mode of existing <i>quoad</i> some
particular subject. A being more limited than man
might be so framed as to be unable to conceive curve
lines; but this subjective inaptitude for those determinations
of space would not affect the objective reality
of curves, or even their subjective reality for a higher
intelligence. Thus, on the hypothesis of an objective
existence for space, we should be thrown upon an
ocean of possibilities, without a test for saying what
was&mdash;what was not possible. But, on the other
hypothesis, having always in the last resort what is
<i>subjectively</i> possible or impossible (<i>i. e.</i> what is conceivable
or not by us, what can or cannot be drawn
or circumscribed by a human imagination), we have
the means of demonstration in our power, by having
the ultimate appeals in our power to a known uniform
test&mdash;viz. a known human faculty.</p>

<p>This is no trifling matter, and therefore no trifling
advantage on the side of Kant and his philosophy, to
all who are acquainted with the disagreeable controversies
of late years among French geometricians
of the first rank, and sometimes among British ones,
on the question of mathematical evidence. Legendre
and Professor Leslie took part in one such a dispute;
and the temper in which it was managed was worthy
of admiration, as contrasted with the angry controversies
of elder days, if, indeed, it did not err in
an opposite spirit, by too elaborate and too calculating
a tone of reciprocal flattery. But think as we may of
the discussion in this respect, most assuredly it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>painful to witness so infirm a philosophy applied to
an interest so mighty. The whole aerial superstructure&mdash;the
heaven-aspiring pyramid of geometrical
synthesis&mdash;all tottered under the palsying logic of
evidence, to which these celebrated mathematicians
appealed. And wherefore?&mdash;From the want of any
philosophic account of space, to which they might
have made a common appeal, and which might have
so far discharged its debt to truth, as at least to
reconcile its theory with the great outstanding phenomena
in the most absolute of sciences. Geometry
is the <i>science</i> of space: therefore, in any <i>philosophy</i> of
space, geometry is entitled to be peculiarly considered,
and used as a court of appeal. Geometry has these
two further claims to distinction&mdash;that, 1st, It is the
most perfect of the sciences, so far as it has gone;
and, 2ndly, That it has gone the farthest. A philosophy
of space, which does not consider and does not reconcile
to its own doctrines the facts of geometry, which,
in the two points of beauty and of vast extent, is
more like a work of nature than of man, is, <i>prim&acirc;
facie</i>, of no value. A philosophy of space <i>might</i> be
false, which should harmonise with the facts of
geometry&mdash;it <i>must</i> be false, if it contradict them.
Of Kant's philosophy it is a capital praise, that its
very opening section&mdash;that section which treats the
question of space, not only quadrates with the facts
of geometry, but also, by the <i>subjective</i> character
which it attributes to space, is the very first philosophic
scheme which explains and accounts for the
cogency of geometrical evidence.</p>

<p>These are the two primary merits of the transcendental
theory&mdash;1st, Its harmony with mathematics,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>and the fact of having first, by its doctrine of space,
applied philosophy to the nature of geometrical
evidence; 2ndly, That it has filled up, by means of
its doctrine of categories, the great <i>hiatus</i> in all
schemes of the human understanding from Plato
downwards. All the rest, with a reserve as to the
part which concerns the <i>practical</i> reason (or will), is
of more questionable value, and leads to manifold
disputes. But I contend, that, had transcendentalism
done no other service than that of laying a foundation,
sought but not found for ages, to the human understanding&mdash;namely,
by showing an intelligible genesis
to certain large and indispensable ideas&mdash;it would
have claimed the gratitude of all profound inquiries.
To a reader still disposed to undervalue Kant's service
in this respect, I put one parting question&mdash;Wherefore
he values Locke? What has <i>he</i> done, even if value is
allowed in full to his pretensions? Has the reader
asked himself <i>that</i>? He gave a <i>negative</i> solution at
the most. He told his reader that certain disputed
ideas were <i>not</i> deduced thus and thus. Kant, on the
other hand, has given him at the least a <i>positive</i>
solution. He teaches him, in the profoundest revelation,
by a discovery in the most absolute sense on
record, and the most entirely a single act&mdash;without
parts, or contributions, or stages, or preparations from
other quarters&mdash;that these long disputed ideas could
not be derived from the experience assigned by Locke,
inasmuch as they are themselves <i>previous conditions
under which any experience at all is possible</i>: he teaches
him that these ideas are not mystically originated,
but are, in fact, but another phasis of the functions,
or, forms of his own understanding; and, finally, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>gives consistency, validity, and a charter of authority,
to certain modes of <i>nexus</i>, without which the sum
total of human experience would be a rope of sand.</p>

<p>In terminating this slight account of the Kantian
philosophy, I may mention that in or about the year
1818-19, Lord Grenville, when visiting the lakes of
England, observed to Professor Wilson that, after five
years' study of this philosophy, he had not gathered
from it one clear idea. Wilberforce, about the same
time, made the same confession to another friend of
my own.</p>

<p>It is not usual for men to meet with their capital
disappointments in early life, at least not in youth.
For, as to disappointments in love, which are doubtless
the most bitter and incapable of comfort, though
otherwise likely to arise in youth, they are in this
way made impossible at a very early age, that no
man can be in love to the whole extent of his capacity,
until he is in full possession of all his faculties, and
with the sense of dignified maturity. A perfect love,
such as is necessary to the anguish of a perfect disappointment,
presumes also for its object not a mere
girl, but woman, mature both in person and character,
and womanly dignity. This sort of disappointment,
in a degree which could carry its impression through
life, I cannot therefore suppose occurring earlier than
at twenty-five or twenty-seven. My disappointment&mdash;the
profound shock with which I was repelled from
German philosophy, and which thenceforwards tinged
with cynical disgust towards man in certain aspects,
a temper which, originally, I will presume to consider
the most benign that can ever have been created&mdash;occurred
when I was yet in my twentieth year. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>a poem under the title of <i>Saul</i>, written many years
ago by Mr. Sotheby, and perhaps now forgotten,
having never been popular, there occurs a passage of
some pathos, in which Saul is described as keeping
amongst the splendid equipments of a royal wardrobe,
that particular pastoral habit which he had worn in
his days of earliest manhood, whilst yet humble and
undistinguished by honour, but also yet innocent and
happy. There, also, with the same care, he preserved
his shepherd's crook, which, in hands of youthful
vigour, had been connected with remembrances of
heroic prowess. These memorials, in after times of
trouble or perplexity, when the burthen of royalty,
its cares, or its feverish temptations, pointed his
thoughts backwards, for a moment's relief, to scenes
of pastoral gaiety and peace, the heart-wearied prince
would sometimes draw from their repository, and in
solitude would apostrophise them separately, or commune
with the bitter-sweet remembrances which they
recalled. In something of the same spirit&mdash;but with
a hatred to the German philosopher such as men are
represented as feeling towards the gloomy enchanter,
Zamiel or whomsoever, by whose hateful seductions
they have been placed within a circle of malign influences&mdash;did
I at times revert to Kant: though for
me his power had been of the very opposite kind; not
an enchanter's, but the power of a disenchanter&mdash;and
a disenchanter the most profound. As often as I
looked into his works, I exclaimed in my heart, with
the widowed queen of Carthage, using her words in
an altered application&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Qu&aelig;sivit lucem&mdash;<i>ingemuitque repert&acirc;</i>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Had the transcendental philosophy corresponded to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>my expectations, and had it left important openings
for further pursuit, my purpose then was, to have
retired, after a few years spent in Oxford, to the
woods of Lower Canada. I had even marked out the
situation for a cottage and a considerable library,
about seventeen miles from Quebec. I planned
nothing so ambitious as a scheme of <i>Pantisocracy</i>.
My object was simply profound solitude, such as
cannot now be had in any part of Great Britain&mdash;with
two accessary advantages, also peculiar to
countries situated in the circumstances and under the
climate of Canada: viz. the exalting presence in an
under-consciousness of forests endless and silent, the
everlasting sense of living amongst forms so ennobling
and impressive, together with the pleasure attached
to natural agencies, such as frost, more powerfully
manifested than in English latitudes, and for a much
longer period. I hope there is nothing fanciful in all
this. It is certain that, in England, and in all
moderate climates, we are too slightly reminded of
nature or the focus of nature. Great heats, or great
colds (and in Canada there are both), or great hurricanes,
as in the West Indian latitudes, recall us
continually to the sense of a powerful presence, investing
our paths on every side; whereas, in England,
it is possible to forget that we live amongst greater
agencies than those of men and human institutions.
Man, in fact, 'too much man,' as Timon complained
most reasonably in Athens, was then, and is now, our
greatest grievance in England. Man is a weed everywhere
too rank. A strange place must that be with
us, from which the sight of a hundred men is not
before us, or the sound of a thousand about us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, being in this hotbed of man inevitably
for some years, no sooner had I dismissed my
German philosophy than I relaxed a little that spirit
of German abstraction which it had prompted; and,
though never mixing freely with society, I began to
look a little abroad. It may interest the reader,
more than anything else which I can record of this
period, to recall what I saw within the ten first years
of the century, that was at all noticeable or worthy
of remembrance amongst the literati, the philosophers,
or the poets of the time. For, though I am not in
my academic period from 1804 to 1808, my knowledge
of literary men&mdash;or men distinguished in some
way or other, either by their opinions, their accomplishments,
or their position and the accidents of their
lives&mdash;began from the first year of the century, or,
more accurately, from the year 1800; which, with
some difficulty and demurs, and with some arguments
from the Laureate Pye, the world was at length
persuaded to consider the last year of the eighteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In revolutionary times, as when a civil war prevails
in a country, men are much worse, as moral beings,
than in quiet and untroubled states of peace. So
much is matter of history. The English, under Charles
II., after twenty years' agitation and civil tumults;
the Romans after Sylla and Marius, and the still more
bloody proscriptions of the Triumvirates; the French,
after the Wars of the League and the storms of the
Revolution&mdash;were much changed for the worse, and
exhibited strange relaxations of the moral principle.
But why? What is the philosophy of the case?
Some will think it sufficiently explained by the necessity
of witnessing so much bloodshed&mdash;the hearths
and the very graves of their fathers polluted by the
slaughter of their countrymen&mdash;the <i>acharnement</i>
which characterises civil contests (as always the
quarrels of friends are the fiercest)&mdash;and the license
of wrong which is bred by war and the majesties of
armies. Doubtless this is part of the explanation.
But is this all? Mr. Coleridge has referred to this
subject in <i>The friend</i>; but, to the best of my remembrance,
only noticing it as a fact. Fichte, the
celebrated German philosopher, has given us his view
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>of it (<i>Idea of War</i>); and it is so ingenious, that
it deserves mention. It is this&mdash;'Times of revolution
force men's minds inwards: hence they are led
amongst other things to meditate on morals with
reference to their own conduct. But to subtilise
too much upon this subject must always be ruinous
to morality, with all understandings that are not very
powerful, <i>i. e.</i> with the majority, because it terminates
naturally in a body of maxims a specious and covert
self-interest. Whereas, when men meditate less, they
are apt to act more from natural feeling, in which
the natural goodness of the heart often interferes to
neutralise or even to overbalance its errors.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>With a total disbelief in all the vulgar legends of
supernatural agency, and <i>that</i> upon firmer principles
than I fear most people could assign for their incredulity,
I must yet believe that the 'soul of the
world' has in some instances sent forth mysterious
types of the cardinal events, in the great historic
drama of our planet. One has been noticed by a
German author, and it is placed beyond the limits
of any rational scepticism; I mean the coincidence
between the augury derived from the flight of the
twelve vultures as types of the duration of the Roman
empire, <i>i. e.</i> Western Empire, for twelve centuries,
and the actual event. This augury we know to
have been recorded many centuries before its consummation;
so that no juggling or collusion between
the prophets and the witnesses to the final event can
be suspected. Some others might be added. At
present I shall notice a coincidence from our own
history, which, though not so important as to come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>within the class of prefigurations I have been alluding
to, is yet curious enough to deserve mention. The
oak of Boscobel and its history are matter of household
knowledge. It is not equally well known, that
in a medal, struck to commemorate the installation
(about 1636) of Charles II., then Prince of Wales, as
a Knight of the Garter, amongst the decorations was
introduced an oak-tree with the legend&mdash;'Seris factura
nepotibus umbram.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>To the reader.&mdash;This article was written and printed before the
author heard of the lamented death of Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>It is remarkable at first sight that Mr. Malthus,
to whom Political Economy is so much indebted in
one chapter (viz. the chapter of Population), should
in every other chapter have stumbled at every step.
On a nearer view, however, the wonder ceases. His
failures and his errors have arisen in all cases from
the illogical structure of his understanding; his
success was in a path which required no logic. What
is the brief abstract of his success? It is this: <i>he
took an obvious and familiar truth, which until his
time had been a barren truism, and showed that it
teemed with consequences</i>. Out of this position&mdash;<i>That
in the ground which limited human food lay the ground
which limited human increase</i>&mdash;united with this other
position&mdash;<i>That there is a perpetual nisus in the principle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>of population to pass that limit</i>, he unfolded a body of
most important corollaries. I have remarked in
another article on this subject&mdash;how entirely these
corollaries had escaped all Mr. Malthus's<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> predecessors
in the same track. Perhaps the most striking instance
of this, which I could have alleged, is that
of the celebrated French work&mdash;<i>L'Ami des Hommes,
ou Trait&eacute; de la Population</i> (written about the middle
of the last century), which sets out deliberately
from this principle, expressed almost in the very
words of Mr. Malthus,&mdash;'<i>Que la m&eacute;sure de la Subsistance
est celle de la Population</i>;'&mdash;beats the bushes
in every direction about it; and yet (with the exception
of one corollary on the supposed depopulating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>tendency of war and famine) deduces from it none
but erroneous and Anti-Malthusian doctrines. That
from a truth apparently so barren any corollaries
were deducible&mdash;was reserved for Mr. Malthus to
show. <i>As</i> corollaries, it may be supposed that they
imply a logical act of the understanding. In some
small degree, no doubt; but no more than necessarily
accompanies every exercise of reason. Though inferences,
they are not remote inferences, but immediate
and proximate; and not dependent upon each other,
but collateral. Not logic but a judicious choice of
his ground placed Mr. Malthus at once in a station
from which he commanded the whole truth at a
glance&mdash;with a lucky dispensation from all necessity
of continuous logical processes. But such a dispensation
is a privilege indulged to few other parts of
Political Economy, and least of all to that which is
the foundation of all Political Economy, viz. the
doctrine of value. Having therefore repeatedly
chosen to tamper with this difficult subject, Mr.
Malthus has just made so many exposures of his intellectual
infirmities&mdash;which, but for this volunteer
display, we might never have known. Of all the men
of talents, whose writings I have read up to this
hour, Mr. Malthus has the most perplexed understanding.
He is not only confused himself, but is
the cause that confusion is in other men. Logical
perplexity is shockingly contagious: and he, who
takes Mr. Malthus for his guide through any tangled
question, ought to be able to box the compass very
well; or before he has read ten pages he will find
himself (as the Westmorland guides express it)
'maffled,'&mdash;and disposed to sit down and fall a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>crying with his guide at the sad bewilderment into
which they have both strayed. It tends much to
heighten the sense of Mr. Malthus's helplessness in
this particular point&mdash;that of late years he has given
himself the air too much of teasing Mr. Ricardo, one
of the 'ugliest customers' in point of logic that ever
entered the ring. Mr. Ricardo is a most 'dangerous'
man; and Mr. Malthus would do well not to meddle
with so 'vicious' a subject, whose arm (like Neate's)
gives a blow like the kick of a horse. He has
hitherto contented himself very good-naturedly with
gently laying Mr. Malthus on his back; but, if he
should once turn round with a serious determination
to 'take the conceit' out of him, Mr. Malthus would
assuredly be 'put into chancery,' and suffer a
'punishment' that must distress his friends.&mdash;Amongst
those whom Mr. Malthus has perplexed by
his logic, I am not one: in matter of logic, I hold
myself impeccable; and, to say nothing of my sober
days, I defy the devil and all the powers of darkness
to get any advantage over me, even on those days
when I am drunk, in relation to 'Barbara, Celarent,
Darii, or Ferio.'</p>

<p>'Avoid, old Satanas!' I exclaim, if any man
attempts to fling dust in my eyes by false syllogism,
or any mode of dialectic sophism. And in relation
to this particular subject of value, I flatter myself
that in a paper expressly applied to the exposure of
Mr. Malthus's blunders in his Political Economy, I
have made it impossible for Mr. Malthus, even
though he should take to his assistance seven worse
logicians than himself, to put down my light with
their darkness. Meantime, as a labour of shorter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>compass, I will call the reader's attention to the
following blunder, in a later work of Mr. Malthus's&mdash;viz.
a pamphlet of eighty pages, entitled, <i>The
Measure of Value, stated and applied</i> (published in
the spring of the present year). The question proposed
in this work is the same as that already discussed
in his Political Economy&mdash;viz. What is the
measure of value? But the answer to it is different:
in the Political Economy, the measure of value was
determined to be a mean between corn and labour;
in this pamphlet, Mr. Malthus retracts that opinion,
and (finally, let us hope) settles it to his own satisfaction
that the true measure is labour; not the
quantity of labour, observe, which will produce X,
but the quantity which X will command. Upon
these two answers, and the delusions which lie at
their root, I shall here forbear to comment; because
I am now chasing Mr. Malthus's <i>logical</i> blunders;
and these delusions are not so much logical as
economic: what I now wish the reader to attend to&mdash;is
the blunder involved in the question itself; because
that blunder is not economic, but logical. The
question is&mdash;what is the measure of value? I say
then that the phrase&mdash;'measure of value' is an
equivocal phrase; and, in Mr. Malthus's use of it,
means indifferently that which determines value, in
relation to the <i>principium essendi</i>, and that which
determines value, in relation to the <i>principium cognoscendi</i>.
Here, perhaps, the reader will exclaim&mdash;'Avoid,
Satanas!' to me, falsely supposing that I
have some design upon his eyes, and wish to blind
them with learned dust. But, if he thinks <i>that</i>, he
is in the wrong box: I must and will express scholastic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>phrases; but, having once done this, I am then
ready to descend into the arena with no other
weapons than plain English can furnish. Let us
therefore translate '<i>measure of value</i>' into '<i>that which
determines value</i>:' and, in this shape, we shall detect
the ambiguity of which I complain. For I say, that
the word <i>determines</i> may be taken subjectively for
what determines X in relation to our knowledge, or
objectively for what determines X in relation to
itself. Thus, if I were to ask&mdash;'What determined
the length of the racecourse?' and the answer
were&mdash;'The convenience of the spectators who could
not have seen the horses at a greater distance,' or
'The choice of the subscribers,' then it is plain that
by the word 'determined,' I was understood to mean
'determined objectively,' <i>i. e.</i> in relation to the existence
of the object; in other words, what <i>caused</i> the
racecourse to be this length rather than another
length: but, if the answer were&mdash;'An actual
admeasurement,' it would then be plain that by the
word 'determined,' I had been understood to mean
'determined subjectively,' <i>i. e.</i> in relation to our
knowledge;&mdash;what ascertained it?&mdash;Now, in the
objective sense of the phrase, 'determiner of value,'
the measure of value will mean <i>the ground of value</i>:
in the subjective sense, it will mean <i>the criterion of
value</i>. Mr. Malthus will allege that he is at liberty
to use it in which sense he pleases. Grant that he is,
but not therefore in both. Has he then used it in
both? He will, perhaps, deny that he has, and will
contend that he has used it in the latter sense as
equivalent to the <i>ascertainer</i> or <i>criterion of value</i>.
I answer&mdash;No: for, omitting a more particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>examination of his use in this place, I say that his use
of any word is peremptorily and in defiance of his
private explanation to be extorted from the use of
the corresponding term in him whom he is opposing.
Now he is opposing Mr. Ricardo: his <i>labour which X
commands</i>&mdash;is opposed to Mr. Ricardo's <i>quantity of
labour which will produce X</i>. Call the first A, the
last B. Now, in making B the determiner of value,
Mr. Ricardo means that B is the ground of value:
<i>i. e.</i> that B is the answer to the question&mdash;what
makes this hat of more value than this pair of shoes?
But, if Mr. Malthus means by A the same thing,
when by his own confession he has used the term
<i>measure of value</i> in two senses: on the other hand,
if he does not mean the same thing, but simply the
<i>criterion</i> of value, then he has not used the word in
my sense which opposes him to Mr. Ricardo. And
yet he advances the whole on that footing. On
either ground, therefore, he is guilty of a logical
error, which implies that, so far from answering his
own question, he did not know what his own question
was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of the London Magazine.</i><br />

<i>Westmoreland, November 4, 1823.</i><br />
</p>

<p>My dear Sir,&mdash;This morning I received your parcel,
containing amongst other inclosures, the two last
numbers of your journal. In the first of these is
printed a little paper of mine on Mr. Malthus; and
in the second I observe a letter from Mr. Hazlitt&mdash;alleging
two passages from the 403rd and 421st pages
of his <i>Political Essays</i> as substantially anticipating
all that I had said. I believe that he <i>has</i> anticipated
me: in the passage relating to the geometric and
arithmetic ratios, it is clear that he has: in the other
passage, which objects to Mr. Malthus's use of the
term <i>perfection</i>, that he has represented it under contradictory
predicates, it is not equally clear; for I do
not find my own meaning so rigorously expressed as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>to exclude another<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> interpretation even now when I
know what to look for; and, without knowing what to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>look for, I should certainly not have found it: on the
whole, however, I am disposed to think that Mr.
Hazlitt's meaning is the same as my own. So much
for the <i>matter</i> of Mr. Hazlitt's communication: as to
the <i>manner</i>, I am sorry that it is liable to a construction
which perhaps was not intended. Mr. Hazlitt says&mdash;'I
do not wish to bring any charge of plagiarism in this
case;' words which are better fitted to express his own
forbearance, than to exonerate me from the dishonour
of such an act. But I am unwilling to suppose that Mr.
Hazlitt has designedly given this negative form to his
words. He says also&mdash;'as I have been a good deal
abused for my scepticism on that subject, I do not feel
quite disposed that any one else should run away with
the credit of it.' Here again I cannot allow myself to
think that Mr. Hazlitt meant deliberately to bring
me before the reader's mind under the odious image
of a person who was 'running away' with the credit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>of another. As to 'credit,' Mr. Hazlitt must permit
me to smile when I read that word used in that
sense: I can assure him that not any abstract consideration
of credit, but the abstract idea of a credi<i>tor</i>
(often putting on a concrete shape, and sometimes
the odious concrete of a dun) has for some time past
been the animating principle of my labours. Credit
therefore, except in the sense of twelve months' credit
where now alas! I have only six, is no object of my
search: in fact I abhor it: for to be a 'noted' man
is the next bad thing to being a 'protested' man.
Seriously, however, I sent you this as the first of four
notes which I had written on the logical blunders of
Mr. Malthus (the other three being taken not from
his Essay on Population, but from works more expressly
within the field of Political Economy): not
having met with it elsewhere, I supposed it my own
and sent it to complete the series: but the very first
sentence, which parodies the words of Chancellor
Oxenstiern&mdash;('Go and see&mdash;how <i>little</i> logic is required,'
&amp;c.), sufficiently shows that, so far from arrogating
any great merit to myself for this discovery, I thought
it next to miraculous that it should have escaped any
previous reviewer of Mr. Malthus.&mdash;I must doubt, by
the way, whether Mr. Hazlitt has been 'a good deal
abused' for these specific arguments against Mr.
Malthus; and my reason for doubting is this: about
ten or twelve years ago, happening to be on a visit to
Mr. Southey, I remember to have met with a work
of Mr. Hazlitt's on this subject&mdash;<i>not</i> that which he
quotes, but another (<i>Reply to Malthus</i>) which he refers
to as containing the same opinions (either <i>totidem
verbis</i>, or in substance). In Mr. Southey's library,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>and in competition with Mr. Southey's conversation,
a man may be pardoned for not studying any one
book exclusively: consequently, though I read a good
deal of Mr. Hazlitt's <i>Reply</i>, I read it cursorily:
but, in all that I <i>did</i> read, I remember that the
arguments were very different from those which he
now alleges; indeed it must be evident that the two
logical objections in question are by no means fitted
to fill an octavo volume. My inference therefore is&mdash;that
any 'abuse,' which Mr. Hazlitt may have met
with, must have been directed to something else in
his <i>Reply</i>; and in fact it has happened to myself on
several occasions to hear this book of Mr. Hazlitt's
treated as unworthy of his talents; but never on
account of the two arguments which he now claims.
I would not be supposed, in saying this, to insinuate
any doubt that these arguments are really to be found
in the <i>Reply</i>; but simply to suggest that they do
not come forward prominently or constitute the
main argument of that book: and consequently,
instead of being opposed, have been overlooked by
those who have opposed him as much as they were
by myself.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Hazlitt calls the coincidence of my
objections with his own 'striking:' and thus (though
unintentionally, I dare say) throws the reader's attention
upon it as a very surprising case. Now in
this there is a misconception which, apart from any
personal question between Mr. Hazlitt and myself, is
worth a few words on its own account for the sake of
placing it in a proper light. I affirm then that,
considering its nature, the coincidence is <i>not</i> a striking
one, if by 'striking' be meant surprising: and I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>affirm also that it would not have been the more
striking if, instead of two, it had extended to two
hundred similar cases. Supposing that a thousand
persons were required severally to propose a riddle,
no conditions or limitations being expressed as to the
terms of the riddle, it would be surprising if any two
in the whole thousand should agree: suppose again
that the same thousand persons were required to
solve a riddle, it would now be surprising if any two
in the whole thousand should differ. Why? Because,
in the first case, the act of the mind is an act of
synthesis; and there we may readily conceive a
thousand different roads for any one mind; but, in
the second case, it is an analytic act; and there we
cannot conceive of more than one road for a thousand
minds. In the case between Mr. Hazlitt and myself
there was a double ground of coincidence for any
possible number of writers: first the object was
given; <i>i. e.</i> we were not left to an unlimited choice of
the propositions we were to attack; but Mr. Malthus
had himself, by insisting on two in particular (however
erroneously) as the capital propositions of his
system, determined our attention to these two as the
assailable points: secondly, not only was the object
given&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> not only was it predetermined for us
where<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the error must lie, if there were an error;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>but the nature of that error, which happened to be
logical, predetermined for us the nature of the solution.
Errors which are such <i>materialiter</i>, <i>i. e.</i> which
offend against our <i>knowing</i>, may admit of many
answers&mdash;involving more and less of truth. But
errors, which are such logically, <i>i. e.</i> which offend
against the form (or internal law) of our <i>thinking</i>,
admit of only one answer. Except by failing of any
answer at all, Mr. Hazlitt and I could not <i>but</i> coincide:
as long as we had the same propositions to
examine (which were not of our own choice, but
pointed out to us <i>ab extra</i>), and as long as we understood
those propositions in the same sense, no variety
was possible except in the expression and manner of
our answers; and to that extent a variety exists.
Any other must have arisen from our understanding
that proposition in a different sense.</p>

<p>My answer to Mr. Hazlitt therefore is&mdash;that in
substance I think his claim valid; and though it is
most true that I was not aware of any claim prior to
my own, I now formally forego any claim on my own
part to the credit of whatsoever kind which shall ever
arise from the two objections to Mr. Malthus's logic
in his <i>Essay on Population</i>. In saying this, however,
and acknowledging therefore a coincidence with Mr.
Hazlitt in those two arguments, I must be understood
to mean a coincidence only in what really belongs to
them; meantime Mr. Hazlitt has used two expressions
in his letter to yourself which seem to connect
with those propositions other opinions from which I
dissent: that I may not therefore be supposed to
extend my acquiescence in Mr. Hazlitt's views to
these points, I add two short notes upon them: which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>however I have detached from this letter&mdash;as forming
no proper part of its business.&mdash;Believe me, my dear
Sir, your faithful humble servant. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  X.Y.Z.</p>

<p>1. Mr. Hazlitt represents Mr. Malthus's error in
regard to the different ratios of progression as a
<i>mathematical</i> error; but the other error he calls
<i>logical</i>. This may seem to lead to nothing important:
it is however not for any purpose of verbal cavil that
I object to this distinction, and contend that both
errors are logical. For a little consideration will
convince the reader that he, who thinks the first
error mathematical, will inevitably miss the true
point where the error of Mr. Malthus arises; and the
consequence of that will be&mdash;that he will never
understand the Malthusians, nor ever make himself
understood by them. Mr. Hazlitt says, 'a bushel of
wheat will sow a whole field: the produce of that
will sow twenty fields.' Yes: but this is not the
point which Mr. Malthus denies: this he will willingly
grant: neither will he deny that such a progression
goes on by geometrical ratios. If he did, then it is
true that his error would be a mathematical one.
But all this he will concede. Where then lies his
error? Simply in this&mdash;that he assumes (I do not
mean in words, but it is manifestly latent in all that
he says) that the wheat shall be continually resown
on the same area of land: he will not allow of Mr.
Hazlitt's 'twenty fields:' keep to your original field,
he will say. In this lies his error: and the nature of
that error is&mdash;that he insists upon shaping the case
for the wheat in a way which makes it no fair analogy
to the case which he has shaped for man. That it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>unfair is evident: for Mr. Malthus does not mean to
contend that his men will go on by geometrical progression;
or even by arithmetical, upon the <i>same</i>
quantity of food: no! he will himself say the positive
principle of increase must concur with the same sort
of increase in the external (negative) condition, which
is food. Upon what sort of logic therefore does he
demand that his wheat shall be thrown upon the
naked power of its positive principle, <i>not</i> concurring
with the same sort of increase in the negative condition,
which in this case is land? It is true that at
length we shall come to the end of the land, because
that is limited: but this has nothing to do with the
race between man and his food, so long as the race is
possible. The race is imagined for the sake of trying
their several powers: and the terms of the match
must be made equal. But there is no equality in the
terms as they are supposed by Mr. Malthus. The
amount therefore is&mdash;that the case which Mr. Malthus
everywhere supposes and reasons upon, is a case of
false analogy: that is, it is a logical error. But,
setting aside the unfairness of the case, Mr. Malthus
is perfectly right in his mathematics. If it were fair
to demand that the wheat should be constantly
confined to the same space of land, it is undeniable
that it could never yield a produce advancing by a
geometrical progression, but at the utmost by a very
slow arithmetical progression. Consequently, taking
the case as Mr. Malthus puts it, he is right in calling
it a case of arithmetical progression: and his error is
in putting that case as a logical counterpart to his
other case.</p>

<p>2. Mr. Hazlitt says&mdash;'This, Mr. Editor, is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>writer whom "our full senate call all-in-all sufficient."'&mdash;And
why not? I ask. Mr. Hazlitt's inference is&mdash;that,
because two propositions in Mr. Malthus's
Essay are overthrown, and because these two are
propositions to which Mr. Malthus ascribes a false
importance, in relation to his theory, therefore that
theory is overthrown. But, if an architect, under
some fancied weakness of a bridge which is really
strong and self-supported, chooses to apply needless
props, I shall not injure the bridge by showing these
to be rotten props and knocking them away. What
is the real strength and the real use of Mr. Malthus's
theory of population, cannot well be shown, except
in treating of Political Economy. But as to the
influence of his logical errors upon that theory, I
contend that it is none at all. It is one error to
affirm a different law of increase for man and for
his food: it is a second error to affirm of a perfect
state an attribute of imperfection: but in my judgment
it is a third error, as great as either of the
others, to suppose that these two errors can at all
affect the Malthusian doctrine of Population. Let
Mr. Malthus say what he will, the first of those
errors is not the true foundation of that doctrine;
the second of those errors does not contain its true
application.</p>

<p>Two private communications on the paper which
refuted Mr. Malthus, both expressed in terms of
personal courtesy, for which I am bound to make my
best acknowledgments, have reached me through the
Editor of the <i>London Magazine</i>. One of them refers
me 'to the number of the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i> for
March or April, 1821, for an article on Malthus, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>which the view' taken by myself 'of his doctrine, as
an answer to Godwin, seems to have been anticipated.'
In reply to this I have only to express my regret that
my present situation, which is at a great distance
from any town, has not yet allowed me an opportunity
for making the reference pointed out.&mdash;The other
letter disputes the soundness of my arguments&mdash;not
so much in themselves, as in their application to Mr.
Malthus: 'I know not that I am authorised to speak
of the author by name: his arguments I presume
that I am at liberty to publish: they are as follows:&mdash;The
first objection appears untenable for this
reason: Mr. Malthus treats of the abstract tendency
to increase in Man, and in the Food of Man, relatively.
Whereas you do not discuss the abstract
tendency to increase, but only the <i>measure</i> of that
increase, which is food. To the second objection I
thus answer: Mr. Godwin contends not (I presume)
for abstract, essential perfection; but for perfection
relating to, and commensurate with, the capabilities
of an earthly nature and habitation. All this Mr.
Malthus admits <i>argumenti grati&acirc;</i>: and at the same
time asserts that Mr. Godwin's estimate in his own
terms is incompatible with our state. 8th October,
1823.'&mdash;To these answers my rejoinder is this:&mdash;The
first argument I am not sure that I perfectly understand;
and therefore I will not perplex myself or its
author by discussing it. To the second argument I
reply thus: I am aware that whatsoever Mr. Malthus
admits from Mr. Godwin, he admits only <i>argumenti
grati&acirc;.</i> But for whatsoever purpose he admits it, he
is bound to remember, that he <i>has</i> admitted it. Now
what is it that he has admitted? A state of perfection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
This term, under any explanation of it,
betrays him into the following dilemma: Either he
means <i>absolute</i> perfection, perfection which allows of
no degrees; or he means (in the sense which my
friendly antagonist has supposed) <i>relative</i> perfection,
<i>quoad</i> our present state&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> a continual approximation
to the ideal of absolute perfection, without
ever reaching it. If he means the first, then he is
exposed to the objection (which I have already insisted
on sufficiently) of bringing the idea of perfection
under an inconsistent and destructory predicate. If
he means the second, then how has he overthrown the
doctrine of human perfectibility as he professes to
have done? At this moment, though the earth is far
from exhausted (and still less its powers), many
countries are, according to Mr. Malthus, suffering all
the evils which they could suffer if population had
reached its maximum: innumerable children are born
which the poverty of their parents (no less fatal to
them than the limitation of the earth) causes to be
thrown back prematurely into the grave. Now this
is the precise <i>kind</i> of evil which Mr. Malthus anticipates
for the human species when it shall have reached
its numerical maximum. But in <i>degree</i> the evil may
then be much less&mdash;even upon Mr. Malthus's own
showing: for he does not fix any limit to the increase
of moral restraint, but only denies that it will ever
become absolute and universal. When the principle
of population therefore has done its worst, we may
be suffering the same kind of evil&mdash;but, in proportion
to an indefinitely <i>in</i>creasing moral restraint, an indefinitely
<i>de</i>creasing degree of that evil: <i>i. e.</i> we may
continually approximate to the ideal of perfection:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
<i>i. e.</i> if the second sense of perfection be Mr. Godwin's
sense, then Mr. Malthus has not overthrown Mr.
Godwin.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>March, 1824.</i>)</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>I do not remember that any public event of our
own times has touched me so nearly, or so much with
the feelings belonging to a private affliction, as the
death of Mr. Ricardo. To me in some sense it <i>was</i> a
private affliction&mdash;and no doubt to all others who
knew and honoured his extraordinary talents. For
great intellectual merit, wherever it has been steadily
contemplated, cannot but conciliate some personal
regard: and for my own part I acknowledge that,
abstracting altogether from the use to which a man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>of splendid endowments may apply them&mdash;or even
supposing the case that he should deliberately apply
them to a bad one, I could no more on that account
withhold my good wishes and affection from his
person&mdash;than, under any consideration of their terrific
attributes, I could forbear to admire the power and
the beauty of the serpent or the panther. Simply on
its own account, and without further question, a
great intellect challenges, as of right, not merely an
interest of admiration&mdash;in common with all other
exhibitions of power and magnificence&mdash;but also an
interest of human love, and (where that is necessary)
a spirit of tenderness to its aberrations. Mr. Ricardo
however stood in no need of a partial or indulgent
privilege: his privilege of intellect had a comprehensive
sanction from all the purposes to which he
applied it in the course of his public life: in or out
of parliament, as a senator&mdash;or as an author, he was
known and honoured as a public benefactor. Though
connected myself by private friendship with persons
of the political party hostile to his, I heard amongst
them all but one language of respect for his public
conduct. Those, who stood neutral to all parties,
remarked that Mr. Ricardo's voice&mdash;though heard too
seldom for the wishes of the enlightened part of the
nation&mdash;was never raised with emphasis upon any
question lying out of the province in which he reigned
as the paramount authority, except upon such as
seemed to affect some great interest of liberty or
religious toleration. And, wherever a discussion
arose which transcended the level of temporary and
local politics (as that for example upon corporal
punishments), the weight of authority&mdash;which mere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>blank ability had obtained for him in the House of
Commons&mdash;was sure to be thrown into that view of
the case which upheld the dignity of human nature.
Participating most cordially in these feelings of
reverence for Mr. Ricardo's political character, I had
besides a sorrow not unmixed with self-reproach
arising out of some considerations more immediately
relating to myself. In August and September 1821
I wrote <i>The Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i>:
and in the course of this little work I took occasion
to express my obligations, as a student of Political
Economy, to Mr. Ricardo's 'Principles' of that science.
For this as for some other passages I was justly<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
attacked by an able and liberal critic in the <i>New
Edinburgh Review</i>&mdash;as for so many absurd irrelevancies:
in that situation no doubt they were so;
and of this, in spite of the haste in which I had
written the greater part of the book, I was fully
aware. However, as they said no more than was
true, I was glad to take that or any occasion which
I could invent for offering my public testimony of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>gratitude to Mr. Ricardo. The truth is&mdash;I thought
that something might occur to intercept any more
appropriate mode of conveying my homage to Mr.
Ricardo's ear, which should else more naturally have
been expressed in a direct work on Political Economy.
This fear was at length realised&mdash;not in the way I
had apprehended, viz. by my own death&mdash;but by Mr.
Ricardo's. And now therefore I felt happy that, at
whatever price of good taste, I had in some imperfect
way made known my sense of his high pretensions&mdash;although
unfortunately I had given him no means of
judging whether my applause were of any value. For
during the interval between Sept. 1821 and Mr.
Ricardo's death in Sept. 1823 I had found no leisure
for completing my work on Political Economy: on
that account I had forborne to use the means of
introduction to Mr. Ricardo which I commanded
through my private connections or simply as a man
of letters: and in some measure therefore I owed it
to my own neglect&mdash;that I had for ever lost the
opportunity of benefiting by Mr. Ricardo's conversation
or bringing under his review such new speculations
of mine in Political Economy as in any point
modified his own doctrines&mdash;whether as corrections of
supposed oversights, as derivations of the same truth
from a higher principle, as further illustrations or
proofs of anything which he might have insufficiently
developed, or simply in the way of supplement to his
known and voluntary omissions. All this I should
have done with the utmost fearlessness of giving
offence, and not for a moment believing that Mr.
Ricardo would have regarded anything in the light
of an undue liberty, which in the remotest degree
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>might seem to affect the interests of a science so
eminently indebted to himself. In reality candour
may be presumed in a man of first-rate understanding&mdash;not
merely as a moral quality&mdash;but almost as a
part of his intellectual constitution <i>per se</i>; a spacious
and commanding intellect being magnanimous in a
manner <i>suo jure</i>, even though it should have the
misfortune to be allied with a perverse or irritable
temper. On this consideration I would gladly have
submitted to the review of Mr. Ricardo, as indisputably
the first of critics in this department, rather
than to any other person, my own review of himself.
That I have forfeited the opportunity of doing this&mdash;is
a source of some self-reproach to myself. I regret
also that I have forfeited the opportunity of perhaps
giving pleasure to Mr. Ricardo by liberating him
from a few misrepresentations, and placing his vindication
upon a firmer basis even than that which he
has chosen. In one respect I enjoy an advantage for
such a service, and in general for the polemic part of
Political Economy, which Mr. Ricardo did not. The
course of my studies has led me to cultivate the
scholastic logic. Mr. Ricardo has obviously neglected
it. Confiding in his own conscious strength, and no
doubt participating in the common error of modern
times as to the value of artificial logic, he has taken
for granted that the Aristotelian forms and the exquisite
science of distinctions matured by the subtilty
of the schoolmen can achieve nothing in substance
which is beyond the power of mere sound good sense
and robust faculties of reasoning; or at most can
only attain the same end with a little more speed and
adroitness. But this is a great error: and it was an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>ill day for the human understanding when Lord
Bacon gave his countenance to a notion, which his
own exclusive study of one department in philosophy
could alone have suggested. Distinctions previously
examined&mdash;probed&mdash;and accurately bounded, together
with a terminology previously established, are the
crutches on which all minds&mdash;the weakest and the
strongest&mdash;must alike depend in many cases of
perplexity: from pure neglect of such aids, which are
to the unassisted understanding what weapons are to
the unarmed human strength or tools and machinery
to the naked hand of art, do many branches of knowledge
at this day languish amongst those which are
independent of experiment.</p>

<p>As the best consolation to myself for the lost
opportunities with which I have here reproached
myself,&mdash;and as the best means of doing honour to
the memory of Mr. Ricardo,&mdash;I shall now endeavour
to spread the knowledge of what he has performed in
Political Economy. To do this in the plainest and
most effectual manner, I shall abstain from introducing
any opinions peculiar to myself, excepting
only when they may be necessary for the defence of
Mr. Ricardo against objections which have obtained
currency from the celebrity of their authors&mdash;or in
the few cases where they may be called for by the
errors (as I suppose them to be) even of Mr. Ricardo.&mdash;In
using this language, I do not fear to be taxed
with arrogance: we of this day stand upon the
shoulders of our predecessors; and that I am able to
detect any errors in Mr. Ricardo&mdash;I owe, in most
instances, to Mr. Ricardo himself.</p>

<h3>PLANS FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF BOYS IN LARGE NUMBERS.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></h3>

<p class="center">(<i>April and May, 1824.</i>)</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>This is the work of a very ingenious man, and
records the most original experiment in Education
which in this country at least has been attempted
since the date of those communicated by the Edgeworths.
We say designedly 'in this country;' because
to compare it with some continental schemes
which have been only recently made known to the
English public (and not fully made known even yet)
would impose upon us a minute review of those
schemes, which would be, <i>first</i>, disproportionate to
our limits&mdash;<i>secondly</i>, out of its best situation, because
it would be desirable to examine those schemes
separately for the direct purpose of determining their
own absolute value, and not indirectly and incidentally
for the purpose of a comparison. The Madras system,
again, is excluded from the comparison&mdash;not so much
for the reason alleged (pp. 123-5), by the author
before us&mdash;as though that system were <i>essentially</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
different from his own in its purpose and application:
the <i>purpose</i> of the Madras system is not exclusively
economy of expense, but in combination with that
purpose a far greater accuracy (and therefore reality)
in the knowledge communicated than could be obtained
on the old systems; on this account therefore
the possible <i>application</i> of the Madras system is not
simply to the education of the poor, though as yet
the actual application of it may have been chiefly to
them, but also to the education of the rich; and in
fact it is well known that the Madras system (so far
from being <i>essentially</i> a system for the poor) has been
adopted in some of the great classical schools of the
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The difference is more logically stated
thus&mdash;that the Madras system regards singly the
quality of the knowledge given, and (with a view to
<i>that</i>) the mode of giving it: whereas the system,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>which we are going to review, does not confine its
view to <i>man as a being capable of knowledge</i>, but
extends it to <i>man as a being capable of action, moral or
prudential</i>: it is therefore a much more comprehensive
system. The system before us does not exclude the
final purpose of the Madras system: on the contrary,
it is laudably solicitous for the fullest and most
accurate communication of knowledge, and suggests
many hints for the attainment of that end as just and
as useful as they are enlightened. But it does not
stop here: it goes further, and contemplates the
whole man with a reference to his total means of usefulness
and happiness in life. And hence, by the way,
it seems to us essential&mdash;that the whole child should
on this system be surrendered to the school; <i>i. e.</i> that
there should be no day-scholars; and this principle
we shall further on endeavour to establish on the
evidence of a case related by the author himself.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> On
the whole therefore we have designedly stated our
general estimate of the author's system with a reference
to that of the Edgeworths; not only because it
has the same comprehensiveness of object, and is in
some degree a further expansion of their method and
their principles; but also because the author himself
strikingly resembles the Edgeworths in style and
composition of mind; with this single difference perhaps,
that the good sense and perception of propriety
(of what in French would be called <i>les convenances</i>),
which in both is the characteristic merit (and, when it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>comes into conflict with any higher quality, the characteristic
defect),&mdash;in him is less coloured by sarcastic
and contemptuous feelings; which in all cases are unamiable
feelings, and argue some defect of wisdom
and magnanimity; but, when directed (as in the Edgeworths
they sometimes are) against principles in
human nature which lie far beyond the field of their
limited philosophy, recoil with their whole strength
upon those who utter them. It is upon this consideration
of his intellectual affinity with the Edgeworths
that we are the less disposed to marvel at his estimate
of their labours: that, for instance, at p. 192 he styles
their work on education 'inestimable,' and that at
p. 122, though he stops short of proposing 'divine
honours' to Miss Edgeworth, the course of his logic
nevertheless binds him to mean that on Grecian
principles such honours are 'due to her.' So much
for the general classification and merits of the author,
of whom we know nothing more than&mdash;that, from his
use of the Scotticisms&mdash;'succumb,'&mdash;'compete,'&mdash;and
'in place of' for 'instead of' he ought to be a Scotchman:
now then for his system.</p>

<p>Of this we may judge by two criteria&mdash;experimentally
by its result, or <i>&agrave; priori</i> by its internal aptitude
for attaining its ends. Now as to the result, it must
be remembered that&mdash;even if the author of any system
could be relied on as an impartial witness to its
result&mdash;yet, because the result of a system of education
cannot express itself in any one insulated fact, it
will demand as much judgment to abstract from any
limited experience what really <i>is</i> the result as would
have sufficed to determine its merits <i>&agrave; priori</i> without
waiting for any result. Consequently, as it would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>impossible to exonerate ourselves from the necessity
of an elaborate act of judgment by any appeal to the
practical test of the result&mdash;seeing that this result
would again require an act of judgment hardly less
elaborate for its satisfactory settlement than the <i>&agrave;
priori</i> examination which it had been meant to
supersede,&mdash;we may as well do that at first which we
must do in the end; and, relying upon our own understandings,
say boldly that the system is good or
bad because on this argument it is evidently calculated
to do good or on that argument to do evil,
than blindly pronounce&mdash;it is good or it is bad, because
it has produced&mdash;or has failed of producing&mdash;such
and such effects; even if those effects were easy
to collect. In fact, for any conclusive purpose of a
practical test, the experience is only now beginning
to accumulate: and here we may take occasion to
mention that we had ourselves been misinformed as
to the duration of the experiment; for a period of
four years, we were told, a school had existed under
the system here developed: but this must be a
mistake, founded perhaps on a footnote at p. 83 which
says&mdash;'The plan has now been in operation more
than four years:' but the plan there spoken of is not
the general system, but a single feature of it&mdash;viz. the
abolition of corporal punishment: in the text this
plan had been represented as an immature experiment,
having then 'had a trial of nine months' only:
and therefore, as more than three years nine months
had elapsed from that time to the publication of the
book, a note is properly added declaring that the experiment
had succeeded, and that the author could
'not imagine any motive strong enough to force him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>back to the old practice.' The system generally however
must have existed now (<i>i. e.</i> November 1823) for
nearly eight years at the least: so much is evident
from a note at p. 79, where a main regulation of the
system is said to have been established 'early in 1816.'
Now a period of seven or eight years must have been
sufficient to carry many of the senior pupils into active
life, and to carry many of the juniors even into situations
where they would be brought into close comparison
with the pupils of other systems. Consequently,
so much experience as is involved in the fact
of the systems outliving such a comparison&mdash;and in
the continued approbation of its founder, who is
manifestly a very able and a conscientious man,&mdash;so
much experience, we say, may be premised for the
satisfaction of those who demand practical tests. For
ourselves, we shall abide rather in our valuation of
the system by the internal evidence of its composition
as stated and interpreted by its author. An abstract
of all that is essential in this statement we shall now
lay before our readers.</p>

<p>What is the characteristic difference, in the fewest
possible words, of this system as opposed to all
others? We nowhere find this stated in a pointed
manner: the author has left it rather to be collected
from his general exposition; and therefore we conceive
that we shall be entitled to his thanks by placing it
in a logical, if possible in an antithetic, shape. In
order to this, we ask&mdash;what is a school? A school is
a body of young persons more or less perfectly organised&mdash;which,
by means of a certain constitution or
system of arrangements (A), aims at attaining a
certain object (B). Now in all former schemes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>education this A stood to B the positive quantity
sought in the relation of a logical negative (<i>i. e.</i> of a
<i>negation</i> of quantity = <i>0</i>), or even of a mathematic
negative (<i>i. e.</i> of-<i>x</i>):&mdash;but on this new system of the
author before us (whom, for the want of a better
name, we shall call the Experimentalist) A for the
first time bears to B the relation of a positive quantity.
The terms <i>positive</i> and <i>negative</i> are sufficiently opposed
to each other to confer upon our contradistinction of
this system from all others a very marked and antithetic
shape; and the only question upon it, which
arises, is this&mdash;are these terms justified in their
application to this case? That they are, will appear
thus:&mdash;Amongst the positive objects (or B) of every
school, even the very worst, we must suppose the
culture of morals to be one: a mere day-school may
perhaps reasonably confine its pretensions to the disallowance
of anything positively bad; because here
the presumption is that the parents undertake the
management of their children excepting in what
regards their intellectual education: but, wherever
the heads of a school step into the full duties of a
child's natural guardians, they cannot absolve themselves
from a responsibility for his morals. Accordingly,
this must be assumed of course to exist amongst
the positive objects of every boarding-school. Yet so
far are the laws and arrangements of existing schools
from at all aiding and promoting this object, that
their very utmost pretension is&mdash;that they do not
injure it. Much injustice and oppression, for example,
take place in the intercourse of all boys with each
other; and in most schools 'the stern edict against
<i>bearing tales</i>,' causes this to go unredressed (p. 78): on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>the other hand, in a school where a system of nursery-like
<i>surveillance</i> was adopted, and 'every trifling
injury was the subject of immediate appeal to the
supreme power' (p. 80), the case was still worse.
'The indulgence of this querulousness increased it
beyond all endurance. Before the master had time
to examine the justice of one complaint, his attention
was called away to redress another; until, wearied
with investigation into offences which were either too
trifling or too justly provoked for punishment, he
treated all complainants with harshness, heard their
accusations with incredulity, and thus tended, by a
first example, to the re-establishment of the old
system.' The issue in any case was&mdash;that, apart from
what nature and the education of real life did for the
child's morals, the school education did nothing at all
except by the positive moral instruction which the
child might draw from his lessons&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> from B. But
as to A, <i>i. e.</i> the school arrangements, either at best
their effect was = 0; or possibly, by capricious interference
for the regulation of what was beyond their
power to regulate, they actually disturbed the moral
sense (<i>i. e.</i> their effect was =-<i>x</i>). Now, on the
new system of our Experimentalist, the very laws and
regulations, which are in any case necessary to the
going on of a school, have such an origin and are so
administered as to cultivate the sense of justice and
materially to enlarge the knowledge of justice. These
laws emanate from the boys themselves, and are administered
by the boys. That is to say, A (which on
the old system is at best a mere blank, or negation,
and sometimes even an absolute negative with regard
to B) thus becomes a positive agent in relation to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
B&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> to one of the main purposes of the school.
Again, to descend to an illustration of a lower order,
in most schools arithmetic is one part of B: now on
the new system it is so contrived that what is technically
termed <i>calling over</i>, which on any system is a
necessary arrangement for the prevention of mischief,
and which usually terminates there (<i>i. e.</i> in an effect
= 0), becomes a positive means of cultivating an
elementary rule of arithmetic in the junior students&mdash;and
an attention to accuracy in all: <i>i. e.</i> here again,
from being simply = 0, A becomes = + <i>x</i> in relation
to B. A school in short, on this system, burns its
own smoke: The mere negative conditions of its daily
goings on, the mere waste products of its machinery,
being converted into the positive pabulum of its life
and motion. Such then, we affirm, is the brief
abstract&mdash;antithetically expressed&mdash;of the characteristic
principle by which the system under review is
distinguished from all former systems. In relation to
B (which suppose 20 <i>x</i>) A, which heretofore was =-<i>x</i>,
or at best = 0, now becomes = + <i>x</i>, or + 2 <i>x</i>, or 3 <i>x</i>,
as it may happen. In this lies the merit of the conception:
what remains to be inquired&mdash;is in what
degree, and upon what parts of B, it attains this conversion
of A into a positive quantity: and this will
determine the merit of the execution. Let us now
therefore turn to the details of the book.</p>

<p>The book may be properly distributed into two
parts: the first of which from page 1 to page 125 inclusively
(comprehending the three first chapters)
unfolds and reviews the system: all that remains from
page 126 to page 218 inclusively (<i>i. e.</i> to the end)&mdash;
comprehending four chapters&mdash;may be considered as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>second or miscellaneous part, treating of some general
topics in the business of education, but with a continual
reference to the principles laid down in the
first part. An appendix, of twenty pages, contains a
body of illustrative documents. The first of the three
chapters, composing what we have called the first
part, is entitled <i>Outline of the System</i>: and, as it is
very brief, we shall extract it nearly entire.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'A schoolmaster being a governor as well as a
teacher, we must consider the boys both as a community
and as a body of pupils. The principle of our
government is to leave, as much as possible, all power
in the hands of the boys themselves: To this end we
permit them to elect a committee, which enacts the
laws of the school, subject however to the <i>veto</i> of the
head master. We have also courts of justice for the
trial of both civil and criminal causes, and a vigorous
police for the preservation of order. Our rewards
consist of a few prizes given at the end of each half
year to those whose exertions have obtained for them
the highest rank in the school; and certain marks
which are gained from time to time by exertions of
talent and industry. These marks are of two kinds:
the most valuable, called premial<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> marks, will purchase
a holiday; the others are received in liquidation
of forfeits. Our punishments<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> are fine and imprisonment.
Impositions, public disgrace, and corporeal
pain, have been for some years discarded among us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
To obtain rank is an object of great ambition among
the boys; with us it is entirely dependent on the
state of their acquirements; and our arrangements
according to excellence are so frequent&mdash;that no one
is safe, without constant exertion, from losing his
place. The boys learn almost every branch of study in
classes, that the master may have time for copious explanations;
it being an object of great anxiety with
us, that the pupil should be led to reason upon all
his operations. Economy of time is a matter of
importance with us: we look upon all restraint as an
evil, and to young persons as a very serious evil: we
are therefore constantly in search of means for ensuring
the effective employment of every minute
which is spent in the school-room, that the boys may
have ample time for exercise in the open air. The
middle state between work and play is extremely unfavourable
to the habits<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of the pupil: we have
succeeded, by great attention to order and regularity,
in reducing it almost to nothing. We avoid much
confusion by accustoming the boys to march; which
they do with great precision, headed by a band of
young performers<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> from their own body.'</p></div>

<p>Such is the outline of the system as sketched by
the author himself: to us however it appears an
insufficient outline even for 'the general reader' to
whom it is addressed: without having 'any intention
of reducing the system to practice,' the most general
reader, if he asks for any information at all, will ask
for more than this. We shall endeavour therefore to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>draw up an account of the plan somewhat less meagre,
by separating the important from the trivial details.
For this purpose we shall begin&mdash;1. with the <span class="smcap">GOVERNMENT</span>
of the school; <i>i. e.</i> with an account of the
<i>legislative</i>, the <i>executive</i>, and the <i>judicial</i> powers,
where lodged&mdash;held by what tenure&mdash;and how administered.
The <i>legislative power</i> is vested in a committee
of boys elected by the boys themselves. The
members are elected monthly; the boy, who ranks
highest in the school, electing one member; the <i>two</i>
next in rank another; the <i>three</i> next a third; and so
on. The head-master as well as all the under-masters
are members by virtue of their office. This arrangement
might seem likely to throw a dangerous weight
in the deliberations of the 'house' into the hands of
the executive power, especially as the head-master
might pursue Queen Anne's policy under the Tory
ministers&mdash;and, by introducing the fencing-master&mdash;the
dancing-master&mdash;the riding-master, &amp;c. under the
unconstitutional equivocation of the word '<i>teachers</i>,'
carry a favourite measure in the teeth of the patriotic
party. Hitherto however the reigning sovereign has
shown so laudable a desire to strengthen those checks
upon his own authority which make him a limited
monarch&mdash;that 'only one teacher has been in the
habit of attending the committee's meetings' (p. 5):
and, where any teacher himself happens to be interested
in the question before the house (<i>e. g.</i> in a case
of appeal from any decision of his), 'it has lately been
the etiquette' for that one who does attend to decline
voting. Thus we see that the liberty of the subject is
on the growth: which is a sure argument that it has
not been abused. In fact, as a fresh proof of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>eternal truth&mdash;that in proportion as human beings
are honourably confided in, they will <i>in the gross</i> become
worthy of confidence, it will give pleasure to the
reader to be informed that, though this committee
'has the formation of <i>all</i> the laws and regulations of
the school (excepting such as determine the hours of
attendance and the regular amount of exercises to be
performed),' yet 'the master's assent has never even
in a single instance been withheld or even delayed.'
'I do not remember,' says Sir William Temple in 1683
to his son, 'ever to have refused anything you have
desired of me; which I take to be a greater compliment
to you than to myself; since for a young man
to make none but reasonable desires is yet more extraordinary
than for an old man to think them so.'
A good arrangement has been adopted for the purpose
of combining the benefits of mature deliberation with
the vigour and dispatch necessary for sudden emergencies:
by a standing order of the committee a week's
notice must be given before a new law can be introduced
for discussion: in cases of urgency therefore a
sort of <i>orders of council</i> are passed by a sub-committee
composed of two principal officers for the time being:
these may of course be intercepted <i>in limine</i> by the
<i>veto</i> of the master; and they may be annulled by the
general committee: in any case they expire in a
fortnight: and thus not only is a present necessity
met, but also an opportunity gained for trying the
effect of a law before it is formally proposed. The
<i>executive</i> body, exclusively of its standing members
the upper and lower masters, is composed of a sheriff
(whose duties are to levy fines imposed by the court
of justice, and to imprison on non-payment)&mdash;of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>magistrate, and of two constables. All these officers
are elected every month by the committee immediately
after its own election. The magistrate is bound, in
conjunction with his constables, to detect all offences
committed in the school: petty cases of dispute he
decides himself, and so far becomes a <i>judicial</i> officer:
cases beyond his own jurisdiction he sends to the
attorney-general, directing him to draw an impeachment
against the offending party: he also enforces all
penalties below a certain amount. Of the <i>judicial</i>
body we shall speak a little more at length. The
principal officers of the court are the judge who is
elected monthly by the committee, and the attorney-general
who is appointed at the same time by the
master. The court assembles every week: and the
jury, consisting of six, is 'chosen by lot from among
the whole number of qualified boys:' disqualifications
arise in three ways; on account of holding a judicial
office, on account of conviction by the court within
the preceding month, and on account of youth (or,
what we presume to be tantamount, being 'in certain
lower classes'). The jury choose their own foreman.
The attorney-general and the accused party, if the
case be penal, and each disputant, if civil, has a
<i>peremptory</i> challenge of three, and an unlimited right
of challenge <i>for cause</i>. The judge decides upon the
validity of the objections. Such is the constitution
of the court: its forms of proceeding we cannot state
in fewer words than those of the Experimentalist,
which we shall therefore quote: 'The officers of the
court and the jury having taken their seats, the
defendant (when the cause is penal) is called to the
bar by the crier of the court, and placed between the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>constables. The clerk of the court then reads the
indictment, at the close of which the defendant is
asked if he object to any of the jury&mdash;when he may
make his challenges (as before stated). The same
question is put to the attorney-general. A short
time is then allowed the defendant to plead <i>guilty</i>, if
he be so disposed: he is asked no question however
that he may not be induced to tell a falsehood: but,
in order to encourage an acknowledgment of the fault,
when he pleads <i>guilty</i>&mdash;a small deduction is made
from the penalty appointed by the law for the
offence. The consequence is&mdash;that at least five out
of six of those who are justly accused acknowledge
the offence in the first instance. If the defendant be
determined to stand his trial, the attorney-general
opens the case and the trial proceeds. The defendant
may either plead his own cause, or employ a school-fellow
as counsel&mdash;which he sometimes does. The
judge takes notes of the evidence, to assist him in
delivering his charge to the jury: in determining the
sentence he is guided by the regulations enacted by
the committee, which affix punishments varying with
the magnitude of the offence and the age of the
defendant, but invest the judge with the power of
increasing or diminishing the penalty to the extent of
one-fourth.' A copy of the sentence is laid before the
master, who has of course 'the power of mitigation or
pardon.' From the decision of the court there lies
an appeal to the committee, which is thus not only
the legislative body, but also the supreme court of
judicature. Two such appeals however are all that
have yet occurred: both were brought by the attorney-general&mdash;of
course therefore against verdicts of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>acquittal; and both verdicts were reversed. Fresh
evidence however was in both cases laid before the
committee in addition to that which had been heard
in the court below; and on this as well on other
grounds there was good reason to acquit the jury of
all partiality. Whilst appeals have thus been so rare
from the verdicts of juries, appeals from the decisions
of the magistrate, and even from those of the teachers,
have been frequent: generally indeed the decisions
have been affirmed by the committee; and, when
they have been reversed, in all but two cases the reversal
has met with the sanction of the teachers as
a body. Even in these two (where, by the way, the
original decision was only modified and not annulled);
the Experimentalist is himself of opinion (p. 12) that
the non-concurrence of the teachers may possibly have
been owing to a partiality on their side. So far indeed
as his experience had then extended, the Experimentalist
tells us (p. 79) that 'one solitary instance
only' had occurred in which the verdict of the jury
did not coincide with his own opinion. This judgment,
deliberately pronounced by so competent a judge,
combined with the entire acquiescence in the verdict
of the jury which is argued by the non-existence of
any appeals except on the side of the crown (and then
only in two instances), is a very striking attestation
to the spirit of conscientious justice developed in the
students by this confidence in their incorruptible
integrity. 'Great,' says the Experimentalist, 'great,
but of course unexpressed, anxiety has more than
once been felt by us&mdash;lest the influence of a leading
boy, which in every school must be considerable,
should overcome the virtue of the jury: but our fears
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>have been uniformly relieved, and the hopes of the
offender crushed, by the voice of the foreman pronouncing,
in a shrill but steady tone, the awful word&mdash;Guilty!'
Some persons, who hate all innovations,
will pronounce all this '<i>mummery</i>,' which is a very
compendious piece of criticism. For ourselves, though
we cannot altogether agree with the Experimentalist,
who seems to build too much on an assumption that
nature and increasing intercourse with human life
contribute nothing of themselves without any artificial
discipline to the evolution and culture of the
sense of justice and to the power of the understanding
for discovering where justice lies, yet thus much
is evident, 1. That the intellectual faculties must be
sharpened by the constant habit of discriminating
the just and the unjust in concrete cases such as a
real experience of life produces; 2. That the moral
sense must be deepened, if it were only by looking
back upon so large a body of decisions, and thus
measuring as it were, by the resistance which they
had often overcome arising out of their own immediate
interest, the mightiness of the conscientious power
within which had compelled them to such decisions;
3. That all sorts of forensic ability is thus cherished;
and much ability indeed of larger application: thus
the logical faculty of abstracting the essential from
the accidental is involved in the summing up of the
judge; in the pleadings for and against are involved
the rhetorical arts of narrating facts perspicuously&mdash;of
arranging arguments in the best order of meeting
(therefore of remembering) the counter-arguments;
of solving sophisms; of disentangling misrepresentations&mdash;of
weighing the value of probabilities&mdash;to say
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>nothing of elocution and the arts of style and diction
which even the records of the court and the committee
(as is urged at p. 105) must tend to cultivate: 4. (to
descend to a humbler use) that in this way the master
is absolved from the grievous waste of time in administering
justice, which on the old system was
always imperfect justice that it might waste but
little time, and which yet wasted much time though
it was imperfect justice. The author's own <i>moral</i> of
this innovation is as follows (p. 76); and with this
we shall leave the subject: 'We shall be disappointed
if the intelligent reader have not already discovered
that by the establishment of a system of legislation
and jurisprudence wherein the power of the master is
bounded by general rules, and the duties of the
scholar accurately defined, and where the boys are
called upon to examine and decide upon the conduct
of their fellows, we have provided a course of instruction
in the great code of morality which is likely to
produce far more powerful and lasting effects than
any quantity of mere precept.'</p>

<p>We now pass to the other characteristics of the new
system, which seem to lie chiefly in what relates to
<i>economy of time</i>, <i>rewards and punishments</i>, the <i>motives
to exertion</i>, and <i>voluntary labour</i>. For, as to the
<i>musical performances</i> (which occur more than twenty
times a day), we see no practical use in them except
that they regulate the marching; and the marching
it is said teaches to measure time: and measuring
time accurately contributes 'to the order and celerity
with which the various evolutions of the school
are performed,' and also the conquest of 'serious
impediments of speech.' But the latter case not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>occurring (we presume) very frequently, and marching
accurately not being wholly dependant on music,&mdash;it
appears to us that a practice, which tends to throw an
air of fanciful trifling over the excellent good sense of
the system in other respects, would be better omitted.
<i>Division into classes</i> again, though insisted on by the
Experimentalist (see pp. 290, 291) in a way which
would lead us to suppose it a novelty in his own
neighbourhood, is next to universal in England; and
in all the great grammar schools has been established
for ages. All that distinguishes this arrangement in
his use of it&mdash;is this, that the classes are variable:
that is, the school forms by different combinations
according to the subject of study; the boys, who
study Greek together, are not the same who study
arithmetic together. Dismissing therefore these two
arrangements as either not characteristic or not
laudably characteristic, we shall make a brief exposition
of the others. 1. <i>Economy of Time</i>:&mdash;'We
have been startled at the reflection' (says the Experimentalist)&mdash;'that
if, by a faulty arrangement, one
minute be lost to sixty of our boys, the injury sustained
would be equal to the waste of an hour by a
single individual.' Hence, as the Experimentalist
justly argues, the use of classes; by means of which
ten minutes spent by the tutor in explaining a
difficult point to a class of ten boys become equal to
100 minutes distributed amongst them severally.
Great improvement in the economising of time was on
this system derived from exacting 'an almost superstitious
punctuality' of the <i>monitor</i>, whose duty it is
to summon the school to all its changes of employment
by ringing a bell. It is worthy of notice, but to us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>not at all surprising, that&mdash;'when the duty of the
monitor was easy, and he had time for play, the
exact moment for ringing the bell was but seldom
observed: but when, as the system grew more
complex, he was more constantly in requisition, it
was found that with increased labour came increased
perfection: and the same boy who had complained of
the difficulty of being punctual when he had to ring
the bell only ten times in the day, found his duty
comparatively easy when his memory was taxed to a
four-fold amount. It is amusing to see what a living
timepiece the giddiest boy will become during his week
of office. The succession of monitors gradually infuses
a habit, and somewhat of a love of punctuality, into
the body scholastic itself. The masters also cannot
think of being absent when the scholars are waiting
for them: and thus the nominal and the real hours of
attendance become exactly the same.'&mdash;2. <i>Motives to
Exertion.</i> 'After furnishing the pupil with the
<i>opportunity</i> of spending his time to the greatest
advantage, our next case was to examine how we had
supplied him with <i>motives</i>' for so spending it (p. 92).
These are ranged under five heads,&mdash;'Love of knowledge&mdash;love
of employment&mdash;emulation&mdash;hope of reward&mdash;and
fear of punishment,'&mdash;and according to
what the Experimentalist rightly thinks 'their order
of excellence.' The three last, he alleges, are stimuli;
and of necessity lose their power by constant use.
Love of employment, though a more durable motive,
leaves the pupil open to the attractions of any other
employment that may chance to offer itself in competition
with knowledge. Love of knowledge for its
own sake therefore is the mainspring relied on;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>insomuch that the Experimentalist gives it as his
opinion (p. 96) that 'if it were possible for the pupil
to acquire a love of knowledge, and that only during
the time he remained at school, he would have done
more towards insuring a stock of knowledge in
maturer age than if he had been the recipient of as
much learning as ever was infused into the passive
school-boy' by any means which fell short of generating
such a principle of exertion. We heartily agree
with him: and we are further of opinion that this
love needs not to be generated as an independent
birth previously to our commencing the labour of
tuition, but that every system of tuition in proportion
as it approaches to a good one will inevitably
involve the generation of this love of knowledge
concurrently with the generation of knowledge itself.
Most melancholy are the cases which have come
under our immediate notice of good faculties wholly
lost to their possessor and an incurable disgust
for literature and knowledge founded to our certain
knowledge solely on the stupidity and false methods
of the teacher, who alike in what he knew or did
<i>not</i> know was incapable of connecting one spark of
pleasurable feeling with any science, by leading his
pupils' minds to re-act upon the knowledge he attempted
to convey. Being thus important, how shall
a love of knowledge be created? According to the
Experimentalist, first of all (p. 97&mdash;to the word 'zest'
in p. 107) by combining the sense of obvious <i>utility</i>
with all the elementary exercises of the intellect:&mdash;secondly
(from p. 108&mdash;to the word 'rock' in p. 114)
by matching the difficulties of the learner exactly
with his capacity:&mdash;thirdly (from p. 114&mdash;to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>word 'attention' in p. 117) by connecting with the
learner's progress the sense of continual success:&mdash;fourthly
(from p. 117&mdash;to the word 'co-operation' in
p. 121) by communicating clear, vivid and accurate
conceptions. The first means is illustrated by a
reference to the art of learning a language&mdash;to arithmetic&mdash;to
surveying, and to the writing of 'themes.'
Can any boy, for instance, reconcile himself to the
loathsome effort of learning '<i>Propria qu&aelig; maribus</i>'
by any [but] the dimmest sense of its future utility? No,
we answer with the Experimentalist: and we go
farther even than the Experimentalist is disposed to
do (p. 98); for we deny the existence of any future
utility. We, the reviewer of this book, at eight
years of age, though even then passionately fond of
study and disdainful of childish sports, passed some
of the most wretched and ungenial days of our life in
'learning by <i>heart</i>,' as it is called (oh! most ironical
misnomer!), <i>Propria qu&aelig; maribus</i>, '<i>Qu&aelig; genus</i>,' and
'<i>As in pr&aelig;senti</i>,' a three-headed monster worse than
Cerberus: we <i>did</i> learn them <i>ad unguem</i>; and to this
hour their accursed barbarisms cling to our memory
as ineradicably as the golden lines of &AElig;schylus or
Shakspeare. And what was our profit from all this
loathsome labour, and the loathsome heap of rubbish
thus deposited in the memory? Attend, if you
please, good reader: the first professes to teach the
irregularities of nouns as to gender (<i>i. e.</i> which nouns
having a masculine termination are yet feminine, &amp;c.),
the second to teach the irregularities of nouns as to
number (<i>i. e.</i> which want the singular, which the
plural), the third to teach the irregularities of verbs
(<i>i. e.</i> their deviations from the generic forms of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>preterite and the supine): this is what they <i>profess</i>
to teach. Suppose then their professions realised,
what is the result? Why that you have laboriously
anticipated a case of anomaly which, if it do actually
occur, could not possibly cost more trouble to explain
at the time of its occurrence than you are thus premising.
This is as if a man should sit down to cull
all the difficult cases of action which could ever occur
to him in his relations of son, father, citizen, neighbour,
public functionary, &amp;c. under the plea that he
would thus have got over the labour of discussion
before the case itself arrived. Supposing that this
could be accomplished, what would it effect but to
cancel a benevolent arrangement of providence by
which the difficulties of life are distributed with
tolerable equality throughout its whole course, and
obstinately to accumulate them all upon a particular
period. Sufficient for the day is its own evil: dispatch
your business as it arises, and every day clears
itself: but suffer a few months of unaudited accounts,
or of unanswered letters, to accumulate; and a
mountain of arrears is before you which years seem
insufficient to get rid of. This sort of accumulation
arises in the shape of <i>arrears</i>: but any accumulation
of trouble out of its proper place,&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> of a distributed
trouble into a state of convergement,&mdash;no matter
whether in the shape of needless anticipation or needless
procrastination, has equally the practical effect of
converting a light trouble (or none at all) into a heavy
and hateful one. The daily experience of books,
actual intercourse with Latin authors, is sufficient to
teach all the irregularities of that language: just as
the daily experience of an English child leads him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>without trouble into all the anomalies of his own
language. And, to return to the question which we
put&mdash;'What was our profit from all this loathsome
labour?' In this way it was, viz. in the way of
actual experience that we, the reviewer of this book,
did actually in the end come to the knowledge of
those irregularities which the three elegant poems in
question profess to communicate. Mark this, reader:
the logic of what we are saying&mdash;is first, that, if they
<i>did</i> teach what they profess, they would attain that
end by an artificial means far more laborious than
the natural means: and secondly, that in fact they do
<i>not</i> attain their end. The reason of this&mdash;is partly
the perplexed and barbarous texture of the verse,
which for metrical purposes, <i>i. e.</i> to keep the promise
of metre to the mere technical scansion, is obliged to
abandon all those natural beauties of metre in the
fluent connection of the words, in the rhythmus,
cadence, c&aelig;sura, &amp;c. which alone recommend metre as
a better or more rememberable form for conveying
knowledge than prose: prose, if it has no music, at
any rate does not compel the most inartificial writer
to dislocate, and distort it into non-intelligibility.
Another reason is, that '<i>As in pr&aelig;senti</i>' and its
companions, are not so much adapted to the reading
as to the writing of Latin. For instance, I remember
(we will suppose) this sequence of '<i>tango tetigi</i>' from
the '<i>As in P</i>.' Now, if I am <i>reading</i> Latin I meet
either with the tense '<i>tango</i>,' or the tense '<i>tetigi</i>.' In
the former case, I have no difficulty; for there is as
yet no irregularity: and therefore it is impertinent
to offer assistance: in the latter case I <i>do</i> find a
difficulty, for, according to the models of verbs which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
I have learned in my grammar, there is no possible
verb which could yield <i>tetigi</i>: for such a verb as
<i>tetigo</i> even ought to yield <i>tetixi</i>: here therefore I
should be glad of some assistance; but just here it is
that I obtain none: for, because I remember '<i>tango
tetigi</i>' in the direct order, it is quite contrary to the
laws of association which govern the memory in such
a case, to suppose that I remember the inverted order
of <i>tetigi tango</i>&mdash;any more than the forward repetition
of the Lord's prayer ensures its backward repetition.
The practical applicability of '<i>As in pr&aelig;senti</i>' is
therefore solely to the act of <i>writing</i> Latin: for,
having occasion to translate the words 'I touched' I
search for the Latin equivalent to the English word
<i>touch</i>&mdash;find that it is <i>tango</i>, and then am reminded
(whilst forming the preterite) that <i>tango</i> makes not
<i>tanxi</i> but '<i>tetigi</i>.' Such a use therefore I might by
possibility derive from my long labours: meantime
even here the service is in all probability doubly
superfluous: for, by the time that I am called on to
write Latin at all, experience will have taught me that
<i>tango</i> makes <i>tetigi</i>; or, supposing that I am required
to write Latin as one of the earliest means for gaining
experience, even in that case the very same dictionary
which teaches me what is Latin for '<i>touch</i>' teaches
me what is the irregular preterite and supine of <i>tango</i>.
And thus the 'upshot' (to use a homely word) of the
whole business&mdash;is that an effort of memory, so great
as to be capable otherwise directed of mastering a
science, and secondly (because directed to an unnatural
composition, viz. an arrangement of metre, which is
at once the rudest and the most elaborately artificial),
so disgusting as that no accession of knowledge could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>compensate the injury thus done to the simplicity of
the child's understanding, by connecting pain and a
sense of unintelligible mystery with his earliest steps
in knowledge,&mdash;all this hyperbolical apparatus and
machinery is worked for no one end or purpose that
is not better answered by a question to his tutor, by
consulting his dictionary, or by the <i>insensible</i> progress
of daily experience. Even this argument derived from
its utter uselessness does not however weigh so much
with us as the other argument derived from the want
of common-sense, involved in the wilful forestalling
and artificial concentrating into one long rosary of
anomalies, what else the nature of the case has by
good luck dispersed over the whole territory of the
Latin language. To be consistent, a tutor should
take the same proleptical course with regard to the
prosody of the Latin language: every Latin hyperdissyllable
is manifestly accentuated according to the
following law: if the penultimate be long, that
syllable inevitably claims the accent; if short, inevitably
it rejects it&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> gives it to the ante-penultimate.
The determining syllable is therefore the penultimate;
and for the due reading of Latin the sole
question is about the quantity of the penultimate.
According to the logic therefore which could ever
have introduced '<i>As in pr&aelig;senti</i>,' the tutor ought to
make his pupils commit to memory every individual
word in which the quantity was not predetermined
by a mechanical rule&mdash;(as it is <i>e. g.</i> in the gen. plural
<i>[=o]rum</i>, of the second declension, the <i>[=e]runt</i> of the third
per. plurals of the preterite, &amp;c., or the cases where
the vowel is long by position). But what man of
sense would forbear to cry out in such a case&mdash;'Leave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>the poor child to his daily reading: practice, under
correct tuition, will give him insensibly and without
effort all that you would thus endeavour to communicate
through a most Herculean exertion.' Whom has
it cost any trouble to learn the accentuation of his
own language? How has he learned <i>that</i>? Simply
by copying others&mdash;and so much without effort, that
the effort (and a very great effort) would have been
<i>not</i> to copy them. In that way let him learn the
quantity of Latin and Greek penultimates. That
Edmund Burke could violate the quantity of the word
'Vectigal' was owing to his tutor's ignorance, who
had allowed him so to read it; that Lord North, and
every other Etonian in the house, knew better&mdash;was
owing not to any disproportionate effort of memory
directed to that particular word, as though they had
committed to memory a rule enjoining them to place
the accent on the penultimate of the word vectigal:
their knowledge no more rested on such an anticipation
by express rules of their own experience, than
Burke's ignorance of the quantity on the want of such
anticipation; the anticipation was needless&mdash;coming
from a tutor who knew the quantity, and impossible&mdash;coming
from a tutor who knew it not. At this
moment a little boy (three years old) is standing by
our table, and repeatedly using the word <i>mans</i> for <i>men</i>:
his sister (five years old), at his age, made the very
same mistake: but she is now correcting her brother's
grammar, which just at this moment he is stoutly
defending&mdash;conceiving his dignity involved in the
assertion of his own impeccability. Now whence
came the little girl's error and its correction? Following
blindly the general analogy of the language, she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>formed her plural by adding an <i>s</i> to the singular:
afterwards everybody about her became a daily
monitor&mdash;a living <i>Propria qu&aelig; maribus</i>, as she is
in her turn to her brother, instructing her that this
particular word '<i>man</i>' swerved, as to this one particular
point, from the general analogy of the
language. But the result is just as inevitable from
daily intercourse with Latin books, as to the parallel
anomalies in that language. In proportion as any
case of anomaly could escape the practical regulation
of such an intercourse, just in that proportion it must
be a rare case, and less important to be known: whatsoever
the future experience will be most like to
demand, the past experience will be most likely to
have furnished. All this we urge not against the
Eton grammar in particular: on the contrary, as
grammars go, we admire the Eton grammar;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and
love it with a filial partiality from early associations
(always excepting, however, the three lead-mines of
the Eton grammar, '<i>Propria qu&aelig; maribus</i>,' &amp;c. of
which it is not extravagant to say, that the author,
though possibly a good sort of a man in his way, has
undoubtedly caused more human suffering than Nero,
Robespierre, or any other enemy of the human race).
Our opposition is to the general principle, which lies
at the root of such treatises as the three we have been
considering: it will be observed that, making a proper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>allowance for the smallness of the print, these three
bodies of absurd anticipations of exceptions, are collectively
about equal in quantity, and virtually for the
effort to the memory far more than equal, to the whole
body of the rules contained in the Accidence and the
Syntax: <i>i. e.</i> that which exits on account of many
thousand cases is put on the same level of value and
burthen to the memory, as that which exists on
account of itself alone. Here lies the original sin of
grammars, the mortal taint on which they all demand
regeneration: whosoever would show himself a great
artist in the profound but as yet infant art of teaching,
should regard all arbitrary taxes upon the
memory with the same superstition that a wise lawgiver
should regard the punishment of death: the
lawgiver, who sets out with little knowledge (and
therefore little veneration) of human nature, is perpetually
invoking the thunders of the law to compensate
the internal weakness of his own laws: and
the same spirit of levity disposes inefficient teachers
to put in motion the weightiest machinery of the
mind for the most trifling purposes: but we are
convinced that this law should be engraven on the
title page of all elementary books&mdash;that the memory
is degraded, if it be called in to deliver any individual
fact, or any number of individual facts, or for any
less purpose than that of delivering a comprehensive
law, by means of which the understanding is to
<i>produce</i> the individual cases of knowledge wanted.
Wherever exceptions or insulated cases are noticed,
except in notes, which are not designed to be committed
to memory, this rule is violated; and the
Scotch expression for particularising, viz. <i>condescending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>upon</i>, becomes applicable in a literal sense: when
the Eton grammar, <i>e. g.</i> notices <i>Deus</i> as deviating in
the vocative case from the general law for that declension,
the memory is summoned to an unreasonable
act of condescension&mdash;viz. to load itself almost as
heavily for one particular word in one particular case,
as it had done by the whole type of that declension
(<i>i. e.</i> the implicit law for all words contained under
it, which are possibly some thousands). But how
then would we have such exceptions learnt, if not by
an act of the memory? Precisely, we answer, as the
meanings of all the words in the language are
learned: how are <i>they</i> learned? They are known,
and they are remembered: but how? Not by any
act or effort of the memory: they are <i>deposited</i> in the
memory from daily intercourse with them: just as
the daily occurrences of our lives are recorded in our
memories: not through any exertion on our part, or
in consequence of previous determination on our parts
that we will remember them: on the contrary, we
take no pains about them, and often would willingly
forget them: but they stay there in spite of us, and
are pure <i>depositions</i>, settlings, or sediments, with or
without our concurrence, from the stream of our
daily experience.&mdash;Returning from this long excursus
on arbitrary taxations of the memory suggested to us
by the mention of '<i>Propria qu&aelig; maribus</i>,' which the
Experimentalist objects to as disgusting to children
before they have had experience of the cases in which
it furnishes assistance (but which we have objected
to as in any case barren of all power to assist), we
resume the course of our analysis. We left the
Experimentalist insisting on the benefit of directing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>the studies of children into such channels as that the
practical <i>uses</i> of their labours may become apprehensible
to themselves&mdash;as the first mode of producing a
love of knowledge. In some cases he admits that the
pupil must pass through 'dark defiles,' confiding
blindly in his tutor's 'assurance that he will at last
emerge into light:' but still contends that in many
cases it is possible, and where possible&mdash;right, that
he should 'catch a glimpse of the promised land.'
Thus, for example, to construe the language he is
learning&mdash;is an act of 'some respectability in his
eyes' and its uses apparent: meantime the uses of
the grammar are not so apparent until experience has
brought him acquainted with the real cases to which
it applies. On this account,&mdash;without laying aside
the grammar, let him be advanced to the dignity of
actual translation upon the very <i>minimum</i> of grammatical
knowledge which will admit of it. Again, in
arithmetic, it is the received practice to commence
with 'abstract numbers:' but, instead of risking
injury to the child's intellect and to his temper by
thus calling upon him to add together 'long rows of
figures' to which no meaning is attached, he is taught
'to calculate all the various little problems which
may be constructed respecting his tops and marbles,
their price, and their comparative value.' Here the
Experimentalist turns aside for about a page (from
'while,' p. 101&mdash;to 'practicable,' p. 102) to 'acknowledge
his obligations to what is called Mental
Arithmetic&mdash;that is, calculation without the employment
of written symbols.' Jedediah Buxton's preternatural
powers in this way have been long published
to the world, and may now be found recorded in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Encyclop&aelig;dias: the Experimentalist refers also to the
more recent cases of Porson and the American youth
Zerah Colborn: amongst his own pupils it appears
(p. 54) that this exercise is practised in the morning
twilight, which for any other study would not furnish
sufficient light: he does not pretend to any very
splendid marvels: but the following facts, previously
recited at pp. 16 and 17, he thinks may astonish
'those who have not estimated the combined power
of youth, ardour, and practice.' The lower classes
calculate, purely by the mind without any help from
pen or pencil, questions respecting interest; determine
whether a given year be bissextile or not, &amp;c. &amp;c.
The upper classes determine the age of the moon at
any given time, the day of the week which corresponds
with any day of any month, and year, and Easter
Sunday for a given year. They will square any
number not exceeding a thousand, extract the square
root of a number of not more than five places,
determine the space through which a body falls in a
given time, the circumference and areas of circles
from their diameters, and solve many problems in
mensuration: they practise also Mental Algebra, &amp;c.
In mental, no less than in written, Arithmetic, 'by
assimilating the questions to those which actually
occur in the transactions of life,' the pupil is made
sensible that he is rising into the usefulness and respectability
of real business. The imitative principle
of man is thus made to blend with the motive derived
from the sense of utility. The same blended feelings,
combined with the pleasurable influences of open air,
are relied upon for creating the love of knowledge in
the practice of surveying. In this operation so large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>an aggregate of subsidiary knowledge is demanded,&mdash;of
arithmetic, for instance&mdash;of mensuration&mdash;of trigonometry,
together with 'the manual facility of constructing
maps and plans,' that a sudden revelation is
made to the pupils of the uses and indispensableness
of many previous studies which hitherto they had
imperfectly appreciated; they also 'exercise their
discretion in choosing points of observation; they
learn expertness in the use, and care in the preservation
of instruments: and, above all,&mdash;from this feeling
that they are really <i>at work</i>, they acquire that
sobriety and steadiness of conduct in which the elder
school-boy is so often inferior to his less fortunate
neighbour, who has been removed at an early age
to the accompting-house.'&mdash;The value of the sense of
utility the Experimentalist brings home forcibly to
every reader's recollections, by reminding him of the
many cases in which a sudden desire for self-education
breaks out in a few months after the close of an
inefficient education: 'and what,' he asks, 'produces
the change? The experience, however short, of the
utility of acquisitions, which were perhaps lately
despised.' Better then 'to spare the future man
many moments of painful retrospection,' by educing
this sense of utility, 'while the time and opportunity
of improvement remain unimpaired.' Finally, the
sense of utility is connected with the peculiar exercises
in <i>composition</i>; 'a department of education which we
confess' (says the Experimentalist) 'has often caused
us considerable uneasiness;' an uneasiness which we,
on our part, look upon as groundless. For starting
ourselves from the same point with the Experimentalist
and the authority he alleges&mdash;viz. that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
<i>matter</i> of a good theme or essay altogether transcends
the reflective powers and the opportunities for observing
of a raw school-boy,&mdash;we yet come to a very
different practical conclusion. The act of composition
cannot, it is true, create thoughts in a boy's head
unless they exist previously. On this consideration,
let all questions of general speculation be dismissed
from school exercises: especially questions of <i>moral</i>
speculation, which usually furnish the thesis of a
school-boy's essay: let us have no more themes on
Justice&mdash;on Ambition&mdash;on Benevolence&mdash;on the Love
of Fame, &amp;c.: for all theses such as these, which treat
moral qualities as pure abstractions, are stripped of
their <i>human</i> interest: and few adults even could
write endurably upon such subjects in such a shape;
though many might have written very pleasingly and
judiciously upon a moral <i>case</i>&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> on a moral question
<i>in concreto</i>. Grant that a school-boy has no
independent thoughts of any value; yet every boy
has thoughts dependent upon what he has read&mdash;thoughts
involved in it&mdash;thoughts derived from it:
but these he will (<i>c&aelig;teris paribus</i>) be more or less
able to express, as he has been more or less accustomed
to express them. The unevolved thoughts which pass
through the youngest&mdash;the rudest&mdash;the most inexperienced
brain, are innumerable; not detached&mdash;voluntary
thoughts, but thoughts inherent in what is
seen, talked of, experienced, or read of. To evolve
these, to make them apprehensible by others, and
often even to bring them within their own consciousness,
is very difficult to most people; and at times to
all people: and the power, by which this difficulty is
conquered, admits of endless culture: and, amongst
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>the modes of culture, is that of written composition.
The true value of this exercise lies in the necessity
which it imposes of forming distinct ideas&mdash;of connecting
them&mdash;of disposing them into such an arrangement
as that they can be connected&mdash;of clothing them
in words&mdash;and many more acts of the mind: both
analytic and synthetic. All that is necessary is&mdash;to
determine for the young composer his choice of
matter: require him therefore to narrate an interesting
story which he has formerly read; to rehearse the
most interesting particulars of a day's excursion: in
the case of more advanced students, let them read one
of the English state trials, where the evidence is of a
complex character (as the trials on Titus Oates's plot),
or a critical dissertation on some interesting question,
or anything in short which admits of analysis&mdash;of
abstraction&mdash;of expansion&mdash;or exhibition in an altered
shape. Subjects for all this are innumerable; and,
according to the selection made, more or less opportunity
is given for collecting valuable knowledge:
but this purpose is collateral to the one we are speaking
of: the direct purpose is to exercise the mind in
unravelling its own thoughts, which else lie huddled
and tangled together in a state unfit for use, and but
dimly developed to the possessor's own consciousness.&mdash;The
three other modes of producing a love of
knowledge, which the Experimentalist relies on, viz.
the proportioning the difficulties to the capacity of
the learner, the pleasure of success, and the communication
of clear, vivid, and accurate conceptions, are
treated with good sense&mdash;but not with any great
originality: the last indeed (to speak scholastically)
contains the other three <i>eminenter</i>: for he, who has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>once arrived at clear conceptions in relation to the
various objects of his study, will not fail to generate
for himself the pleasure of success; and so of the rest.
But the power of communicating 'accurate conceptions'
involves so many other powers, that it is in
strictness but another name for the faculty of teaching
in general. We fully agree with the Experimentalist
(at p. 118), that the tutor would do well 'to
provide himself with the various weights commonly
spoken of, and the measures of content and of length;
to portion off upon his play-ground a land-chain, a
rood,' &amp;c. to furnish 'maps' tracing 'the routes of
armies;' 'plates exhibiting the costumes' of different
nations: and more especially we agree with him (at
p. 135) that in teaching the classics the tutor should
have at hand 'plates or drawings of ships, temples,
houses, altars, domestic and sacred utensils, robes, and
of every object of which they are likely to read.' 'It
is,' as he says, 'impossible to calculate the injury
which the minds of children suffer from the habit of
receiving imperfect ideas:' and it is discreditable in
the highest degree to the majority of good classical
scholars that they have no accurate knowledge of the
Roman calendar, and no knowledge at all of the
classical coinage, &amp;c.: not one out of every twenty
scholars can state the relation of the <i>sestertius</i> to the
<i>denarius</i>, of the Roman <i>denarius</i> to the Attic <i>drachma</i>,
or express any of them in English money. All such
defects are weighty: but they are not adequate
illustrations of the injury which arises from inaccurate
ideas in its most important shape. It is a
subject however which we have here no room to
enlarge upon.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rewards and Punishments.</span>&mdash;It has already been
mentioned that corporal punishments are entirely
abolished;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and upon the same principle all such
disgrace as 'would destroy self-respect.' 'Expulsion
even has been resorted to, rather than a boy should
be submitted to treatment which might lead himself
and his school-fellows to forget that he was a gentleman.'
In this we think the Experimentalist very
wise: and precisely upon this ground it was that Mr.
Coleridge in his lectures at the Royal Institution
attacked Mr. Lancaster's system, which deviated
from the Madras system chiefly in the complexity
of the details, and by pressing so cruelly in its
punishments upon the principle of shame. 'Public
disgrace' (as the Experimentalist alleges, p. 83) 'is
painful exactly in proportion to the good feeling of
the offender:' and thus the good are more heavily
punished than the bad. Confinement, and certain
disabilities, are the severest punishments: but the
former is 'as rare as possible; both because it is
attended with unavoidable disgrace' (but what
punishment is wholly free from this objection?) 'and
because, unlike labour, it is pain without any utility'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
(p. 183). The ordinary punishments therefore consist
in the forfeiture of rewards, which are certain
counters obtained by various kinds of merit. These
are of two classes, <i>penal</i> (so called from being received
as forfeits) and premial, which are obtained by a
higher degree of merit, and have higher powers
attached to them. Premial counters will purchase
<i>holidays</i>, and will also purchase <i>rank</i> (which on this
system is of great importance). A conflict is thus
created between pleasure and ambition, which generally
terminates in favour of the latter: 'a boy of
fourteen, although constantly in the possession of
marks sufficient to obtain a holiday per week, has
bought but three-quarters of a day's relaxation
during the whole of the last year. The same boy
purchased his place on the list by a sacrifice of marks
sufficient to have obtained for him twenty-six half-holidays.'
The purchase of rank, the reader must
remember, is no way objectionable&mdash;considering the
means by which the purchase-money is obtained. One
chief means is by study during the hours of leisure&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>
by <i>voluntary labour</i>: this is treated of (rather out
of its place) in Chap. VII., which ought to be considered
as belonging to the first part of the work, viz.
to the exposition of the system. Voluntary labour
took its rise from the necessity of furnishing those
boys, who had no chance of obtaining rank through
their talents, with some other means of distinguishing
themselves: this is accomplished in two modes: first,
by giving rewards for industry exerted out of school
hours, and receiving these rewards as the price of
rank; making no other stipulation than one, in
addition to its being 'tolerably well executed'&mdash;viz.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
that it shall be in a state of completion. The
Experimentalist comments justly at p. 187, on 'the
mental dissipation in which persons of talent often
indulge' as being 'destructive beyond what can readily
be imagined' and as leading to 'a life of shreds and
patches.' 'We take care' (says he) 'to reward no
boy for fragments, whatever may be their excellence.
We know nothing of his exertions until they come
before us in a state of completion.' Hence, besides
gaining the 'habit of finishing' in early youth, the
boy has an interest also in gaining the habit of
measuring his own powers: for he knows 'that he
can receive neither fame nor profit by instalments;'
and therefore 'undertakes nothing which he has not
a rational hope of accomplishing.'<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> A second mode of
preventing rank from being monopolised by talents
is by flinging the school into various arrangements,
one of which is founded on 'propriety of manners and
general good conduct.'</p>

<hr />

<p>We have thus gone through a pretty full analysis,
and a very accurate one, of the new system as
contained in the three first chapters. Of the five
miscellaneous chapters, the seventh or last but one
(on <i>voluntary labour</i>), has been interwoven with our
analysis; and the eighth, which contains a comparison
of public and private education, we do not purpose to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>notice; the question is very sensibly discussed; but
it is useless to discuss any question like this, which is
a difficult problem only because it is an unlimited
problem. Let the parent satisfy himself about the
object he has in view for his child, and let him
consider the particular means which he has at his
disposal for securing a good private education, and he
may then determine it for himself. As far as the
attainment of knowledge is concerned,&mdash;it is always
possible to secure a good public education, and not
always possible to secure a good private one. Where
either is possible indifferently, the comparison will
proceed upon more equal grounds: and inquiry may
then be made about the child's destination in future
life: for many destinations a public education being
much more eligible than for others. Under a perfect
indetermination of everything relating to the child&mdash;the
question is as indeterminable as&mdash;whether it is
better to go to the Bank through Holborn or through
the Strand: the particular case being given, it may
then be possible to answer the question; previously
it is impossible.&mdash;&mdash;Three chapters therefore remain,
viz.&mdash;Chap. IV. on Languages; Chap. V. on Elocution;
and Chap. VI. on Penmanship.</p>

<p><i>Chap. IV. On the best method of acquiring Languages.</i>&mdash;The
Experimentalist had occasion to observe
'that, in the Welsh towns which are frequented by
the English, even the children speak both languages
with fluency:' this fact, contrasted with the labour
and pain entailed upon the boy who is learning Latin
(to say nothing of the eventual disgust to literature
which is too often the remote consequence), and the
drudgery entailed upon the master who teaches Latin,&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>fortified by the consideration, that in the
former instance the child learns to speak a new
language, but in the latter only to read it,&mdash;first
drew his attention to the <i>natural</i> mode of learning
languages, <i>i. e.</i> learning them from daily use. This
mode never fails with living languages: but how is
it to be applied to dead languages? The Experimentalist
retorts by asking what is essential to this mode?
Partly the necessity which the pupil is laid under of
using the language daily for the common intercourse
of life, and partly his hearing it spoken by those who
thoroughly understand it. 'Stimulus to exertion
then, and good models, are the great advantages of
this mode of instruction:' and these, he thinks, are
secured even for a dead language by his system: the
first by the motives to exertion which have already
been unfolded; and the second by the acting of Latin
dramas (which had been previously noticed in his
Exposition of the system). But a third imitation of
the <i>natural</i> method he places in the use of translations,
'which present the student with a dictionary
both of words and phrases arranged in the order in
which he wants them,' and in an abstinence from all
use of the grammar, until the learner himself shall
come to feel the want of it; <i>i. e.</i> using it with reference
to an experience already accumulated, and not
as an anticipation of an experience yet to come. The
ordinary objection to the use of translations&mdash;that
they produce indolent habits, he answers thus: 'We
teach by the process of <i>construing</i>; and therefore,
even with the translation before him, the scholar will
have a task to perform in matching the English,
word by word, with the language which he is learning.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
For this <i>natural</i> method of learning languages
he alleges the authority of Locke, of Ascham, and of
Pestalozzi. The best method, with those who have
advanced to some degree of proficiency, he considers
that of double translations&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> a translation first of
all into the mother tongue of the learner, and a re-translation
of this translation back into the language
of the original. These, with the help of extemporaneous
construing, <i>i. e.</i> construing any passage at
random with the assistance of a master who supplies
the meaning of the unknown words as they arise (a
method practised, it seems, by Le Febvre the father
of Madame Dacier, by others before his time, and by
Condillac since)&mdash;compose the chief machinery which
he employs for the communication of dead languages.</p>

<p><i>Chap. V. On Elocution.</i>&mdash;In this chapter there is
not much which is very important. To read well, the
Experimentalist alleges, presupposes so much various
knowledge, especially of that kind which is best
acquired by private reading, and therefore most spares
the labour of the tutor, that it ought reasonably to
bestow high rank in the school. Private reading is
most favourable to the rapid collection of an author's
meaning: but for reading well&mdash;this is not sufficient:
two great constituents of that art remain to be
acquired&mdash;Enunciation and Inflection. These are
best learned by Recitation. Thus far there is no
great novelty: the most interesting part of the
chapter is what relates to Stammering. This defect
is held by the Experimentalist to result from inattention
to rhythmus: so much he thinks has been
proved by Mr. Thelwall. Whatsoever therefore
compels the pupil to an efficient perception of time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>and measure, as for example, marching and music
(p. 32), he resorts to for its correction. Stammerers,
he observes, can all sing: let them be taught to sing
therefore, if not otherwise corrigible: and from this
let them descend to <i>recitative</i>: then to the recitation
of verses distinguished by the simplicity of their
rhythmus, marching at the same time and marking
the accented syllables by the tread of the foot; from
this to the recitation of more difficult verses; from
that to measured prose; thence to ordinary prose;
and lastly to narrative and dialogue.</p>

<p><i>Chap. VI. Of Penmanship.</i>&mdash;This is a subject on
which we profess no experience which could warrant
us in contradicting a writer who should rest his innovations
solely upon that ground: but the writer
before us does not rely on the practical issue of his
own experiment (he does not even tell us what that
issue was), but on certain <i>&agrave; priori</i> arguments, which
we conceive to be ill-reasoned. The amount of the
chapter is this&mdash;that to write a good running hand is
the main object to be aimed at in the art of caligraphy:
we will go farther, and concede that it is the
sole object, unless where the pupil is educated for a
writing-master. Thus far we are agreed; and the
question is&mdash;as to the best means of attaining this
object. On which question the plan here proposed
differs from those in use by the very natural error&mdash;that
what is admitted to be the ultimate object, this
plan would make the immediate object. The author
starts from a false theory of the practice amongst
writing-masters: in order that their pupils may write
small and running hands well, writing-masters (as is
well-known) begin by exacting from them a long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>praxis in large hands. But the rationale of this
praxis escapes the Experimentalist: the large hand
and the small hand stand related to each other, in
the estimate of the masters, as a means to an end;
whereas the Experimentalist supposes them to be
viewed in the relation simply of two co-ordinate or
collateral ends: on which false presumption he
grounds what would on his own view be a very sound
advice; for justly conceiving that the small hand is of
incomparably more use in life, he argues in effect
thus: let us communicate the main object, and then
(if he has leisure and taste for it) let the pupil direct
his attention to the lower object: 'when the running
hand is accomplished,' says he, 'the pupil may (if it
be thought necessary) learn to write the larger hands
according to the received models.' <i>When</i> it is acquired!
'Aye, but in order that it <i>may</i> be acquired,'&mdash;the
writing-master will reply, 'I must first teach the
larger hands.' As well might the professor of dancing
hold out as a tempting innovation to the public&mdash;I
teach the actual dances, the true practical synthesis
of the steps and movements, as it is in fact demanded
by the usage of the ball-room: let others teach the
analytic elements of the art&mdash;the mere useless steps&mdash;to
those who have time to waste on superfluities.
In either art (as in many others) that, which is first
(or rather sole) in order of importance, is last in the
order of attainment: as an object <i>per se</i>, the larger
hand is not wanted at all, either before or after the
running hand: if it does really contribute nothing to
the more accurate formation of the letters, by compelling
the pupil to exhibit his aberrations from the
<i>ideal</i> letter more clearly because on a scale of greater
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>magnitude (which yet in the second sentence of this
chapter our Experimentalist himself admits), then let
it be abandoned at once: for not doing this service,
it does nothing at all. On the other hand, if this be
its specific service, then it is clear that, being no
object <i>per se</i>, but simply a means to an object, it
must have precedency in the order of communication.
And the innovation of our Experimentalist is so far
(in the literal sense of that word) a <i>preposterous</i> inversion
of the old usage: and this being the chief
principle of his 'plan' we desire to know no more of
it; and were not sorry that (p. 178) we found him
declining 'to enter into a detail of it.'&mdash;The business
of the chapter being finished however, there yet
remains some little matter of curiosity. 1. The Experimentalist
affirms that 'Langford's copper-plate
copies, or indeed any other which he has seen, fail' if
tried by a certain test: what test? Why this: that
'the large hand seen through a diminishing glass,
ought to be reduced into the current hand; and the
current hand, magnified, ought to swell into a large
hand.' Whereas, on the contrary, 'the large hands
reduced appear very stiff and cramped; and the magnified
running hand'&mdash;'appears little better than a
scrawl.' Now to us the result appears in a different
light. It is true that the large hands reduced do not
appear good running hands according to the standard
derived from the actual practice of the world: but
why? Simply because they are too good: <i>i. e.</i> they are
<i>ideals</i> and in fact are meant to be so; and have nothing
characteristic: they are purely <i>generic</i> hands, and
therefore want <i>individualisation</i>: they are abstractions;
but to affect us pleasurably, they should be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>concrete expressions of some human qualities, moral or
intellectual. Perfect features in a human face arranged
with perfect symmetry, affect us not at all, as
is well known, where there is nothing characteristic;
the latency of the individual in the generic, and of the
generic in the individual, is that which gives to each
its power over our human sensibilities. And this
holds of caligraphy no less than other arts. And
<i>that</i> is the most perfect hand-writing which unites the
<i>minimum</i> of deviation from the ideal standard of
beauty (as to the form and nexus of the letters) with
the <i>maximum</i> of characteristic expression. It has
long been practically felt, and even expressly affirmed
(in some instances even expanded into a distinct art
and professed as such), that it is possible to determine
the human <i>intellectual</i> character as to some of its
features from the hand-writing. Books even have
been written on this art, as <i>e. g.</i> the <i>Ideographia</i>, or
art of knowing the characters of men from their
hand-writings, by <i>Aldorisius</i>: and, though this in
common with all other modes of <i>physiognomy</i>, as
craniology, Lavaterianism (usually called physiognomy),
&amp;c. &amp;c. has laboured under the reproach of
fancifulness,&mdash;yet we ought not to attribute this
wholly to the groundlessness of the art as a possible
art&mdash;but to these two causes; partly to the precipitation
and imperfect psychology of the professors; who,
like the craniologists, have been over-ready to determine
the <i>indicantia</i> before they had settled according
to any tolerable theory the <i>indicanda</i>; <i>i. e.</i> have
settled what A, what B, what C, shall <i>indicate</i>, before
they have inquired what it was presumable upon
any systematic development of human nature would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>have a right <i>to be indicated</i>; and thus have assigned
an external characteristic to a faculty of the third
order&mdash;suppose (or perhaps a mere accidental effect
of a faculty or a mere imaginary faculty), whilst a
primary faculty went without any expression at all:&mdash;partly,
I say, to this cause which is obviously not
merely a subjective but also an accidental cause; and
partly also to the following cause, which is objective
(<i>i. e.</i> seated in the inherent imperfections of the art itself,
and not removeable therefore by any future
improvements to be anticipated from a more matured
psychology); viz. that the human mind transcends
or overflows the gamut or scale of the art; in other
words, that the qualities&mdash;intellectual or moral, which
ought to be expressed, are far more in number than
the alphabet of signs or expressions by which they are
to be enunciated. Hence it follows as an inevitable
dilemma, that many qualities must go unrepresented;
or else be represented by signs common to them with
other qualities: in the first of which cases we have
an art imperfect from defect, in the other case imperfect
from equivocal language. Thus, for example,
determination of character is built in some cases upon
mere energy of the will (a moral cause); and again
in other cases upon capaciousness of judgment and
freedom from all logical perplexity (an intellectual
cause). Yet it is possible that either cause will
modify the hand-writing in the same way.</p>

<hr />

<p>From the long analysis which we have thus given
of the book recording this new system of education,
it is sufficiently evident that we think very highly of
it. In the hands of its founder we are convinced that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>it is calculated to work wonders; and so strong is
the impression which his book conveys, that he is not
only a man of very extraordinary talents for the
improvement of the science of education, but also a
very conscientious man&mdash;that, for our own parts, we
should confide a child to his care with that spirit of
perfect confidence which he has himself described at
p. 74. There is an air of gentlemanly feeling spread
over the book which tends still further to recommend
the author. Meantime two questions arise on the
system,&mdash;first, is it a good system? which we have
answered:&mdash;secondly, is it a system adapted for
general diffusion? This question we dare not answer
in the affirmative, unless we could ensure the talents
and energy of the original inventor in every other
superintendent of this system.&mdash;In this we may be
wrong: but at all events, it ought not to be considered
as any deduction from the merits of the
author&mdash;as a very original thinker on the science of
education, that his system is not (like the Madras
system) independent of the teacher's, ability, and
therefore not unconditionally applicable.&mdash;Upon some
future occasion we shall perhaps take an opportunity
of stating what is in our opinion the great desideratum
which is still to be supplied in the art of education
considered simply in its <i>intellectual</i> purposes&mdash;viz. the
communication of knowledge, and the development of
the intellectual faculties: purposes which have not
been as yet treated in sufficient insulation from the
<i>moral</i> purposes. For the present we shall conclude
by recommending to the notice of the Experimentalist
the German writers on education. Basedow, who
naturalised Rousseau in Germany, was the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>author who called the attention of the German public
to this important subject. Unfortunately Basedow
had a silly ambition of being reputed an infidel, and
thus created a great obstacle to his own success: he
was also in many other respects a sciolist and a trifler:
but, since his time, the subject has been much cultivated
in Germany: 'Paedogogic' journals even, have
been published periodically, like literary or philosophic
journals: and, as might be anticipated from that love
of children which so honourably distinguishes the
Germans as a people, not without very considerable
success.</p>

<h3>CASE OF APPEAL.</h3>

<p>Our little Courts of Justice not unfrequently
furnish cases of considerable interest; and we are
always willing to make the resemblance between our
microcosm and the world at large as close as possible,
at least in every useful point we are trying to collect
a volume of Reports. As all the boys are expected
to be present during a trial, to give importance to
the proceeding, the time of such as are capable of the
task must be profitably employed in taking notes.
A useful effect may also be produced upon the parties;
and these records will be valuable acquisitions for
those boys who wish to study the laws, and enable
themselves to conduct the jurisprudence of the school.
We shall detail a case which lately occurred, not
because it is the most interesting which could have
been selected, but because there will be nothing in
its publication to hurt the feelings of any person
engaged in the transaction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be vain to attempt any concealment of
the fact that our pupils, like all boys in the full tide
of health and spirits, do not always see the folly of
an appeal to the <i>ultimo ratio regum</i> in so strong a
light as that in which it <i>sometimes</i> appears to older
eyes; and resort is now and then had to trial by
combat, in preference to trial by jury. The candid
and experienced teacher, who knows the difficulty
and the danger of too rigorously suppressing natural
impulses, will not censure us for endeavouring to regulate
this custom, than to destroy it altogether. In
the hope of lessening the number of those <i>fracas</i>
(never very large), a law was proposed, which the
committee adopted, to render it penal for any person,
except the Magistrate and the Constables, to be present
at a battle. Six hours' notice must be given by
both parties, and a tax paid in advance. During the
interval, it is the duty of the Magistrate to attempt
a reconciliation. These regulations were intended to
give opportunity for the passions to cool, and to
check the inclination for display which is often the
sole cause of the disturbance.</p>

<p>We consider the effect on the minds of the spectators
as the worst part of the transaction. There
is something dreadfully brutalising in the shouts of
incitement and triumph which generally accompany
a feat of pugilism. Neither boys nor men ought
ever to witness pain without sympathy. It is almost
needless to say, that, with us, fighting is anything
rather than a source of festivity and amusement.</p>

<p>To return to our story.&mdash;A day-scholar, whose
father's grounds adjoin ours, was discovered by the
Magistrate to have witnessed a battle from a tree
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>which he had climbed for that purpose. The Magistrate
fined him. He appealed, and the question of
his liability was argued at some length before the
Committee.</p>

<p>The ground which the appellant took was, that no
day-scholar could be amenable to the laws of the
school, except during the hours of business, or while
on the premises of the school, and that the alleged
offence was committed out of school hours, and on
his father's land.</p>

<p>Public opinion ran in his favour. The plea that
he was on his father's land seemed to have great
weight with his schoolfellows. To fine a boy under
such circumstances appeared to them like an attempt
to invade the paternal sanctuary, and the motion for
quashing conviction of the Magistrate, at first received
the support of several members of the Committee.</p>

<p>The attending Teacher saw that it would be necessary
to call the attention of the Committee to general
principles, and proposed as an amendment to the
general motion, the following resolution, 'That it is
desirable that the laws should be obeyed at all times,
and in all places.' In support of this amendment he
argued, that as the laws had the happiness of the
school in view, a breach of those laws must certainly
be in some degree destructive of the general good.
That to allow this in certain individuals would be
injurious to the great body, but still more so to the
individuals themselves; and that what was wrong in
the schoolroom or on the playground at eleven in the
morning, could not be right in the fields at six in the
afternoon. In conclusion he said, 'Whether or not
we have the power to fine a person for a breach of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>our laws when he is at a distance from the schools,
is a question which it is not our present business to
determine; but I firmly believe that our laws are
calculated to promote in the highest degree our
welfare, and I wish the advantages to be derived from
obeying them to be as widely diffused as possible.'</p>

<p>The amendment was carried unanimously.</p>

<p>Having determined 'that it was desirable that the
laws should be obeyed at all times and in all places,'
it was necessary in the next place to ascertain whether
it was not a part of our law that such should be
the case.</p>

<p>With this view an amendment was proposed which
declared, that such was the intention of the law, and
in support of it cases were cited in which day-boys
had been punished for offences committed at a distance
from the school. It was also insisted, that in no
single instance had the laws made an exception in
favour of the day-boys. They universally begin by
saying, that, if 'any one,' or 'any pupil,' or 'any boy,'
shall commit such and such an offence, etc., and not
'any boarder,' or 'any day-boy then at school.'</p>

<p>The second amendment was also carried without
opposition.</p>

<p>The question was now confined within very narrow
limits. The Committee had declared that it was
'desirable that the laws should be obeyed at all times
and in all places;' and also, that by law no exception
was made in favour of day-scholars. It only remained
therefore for the Committee to consider, whether the
police of the school had the power to enforce the laws.</p>

<p>It was argued that in this case they had been enforced,
for that the fine had actually been paid, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>that unless the Committee interfered to prevent it,
they would continue to operate as they had done, for
the welfare of the school at large, and for the ultimate
advantage even of the individuals who might
at first appear to be injured.</p>

<p>The amended motion was now put, and the
conviction was unanimously confirmed.</p>

<p>This detail will furnish the reader with a more
correct conception than we could otherwise give him,
of the opportunities with which the sittings of our
little Committees furnish the members for making
some important acquirements.</p>

<p>In the first place, they study the art of reasoning,
and that too under very favourable circumstances;
being fully acquainted with the facts on which they
are called to exercise their judgments, and seeing
them in all their bearings. We believe that intimate
acquaintance with the facts of which we speak to be
the first and most important element in practical
logic. Reasoning, strictly speaking, being no more
than the art of tracing analogies and differences.
The <i>reality</i> of the business in which the students are
engaged is very valuable, inasmuch as it furnishes
them with strong motives to exert all their powers
in the investigation. The matter at issue 'comes
home to their business and bosoms;' it may deeply
affect their interests, and will not pass unnoticed by
their constituents; among whom the question will
be again discussed, and the Committee-men will in
conversation have to defend the opinions they have
officially expressed. Thus every argument is well
canvassed in their minds, and the ideas remain under
consideration for a sufficient time to become permanently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>fixed in their remembrance. The power of
public speaking is also in some degree acquired, and,
we hope, without the countervailing evils which have
been so justly deprecated. The great defects of all
artificial methods of learning the art of debating is,
that it is seldom of any real importance to either
speaker or hearer, on which side the question under
discussion is determined; consequently, the speaker
is more anxious to display his own talents, than to
convince the audience; which, on its part, wishes
rather for amusement than instruction, or seeks the
latter only by watching the conduct of this mental
fencing-match, in order to learn the most skilful
manner of handling the foils. Every one who addresses
the company assembled, feels that he shall be more
applauded for agreeably wandering, than for pointing
out and following the best and straightest road. In
short, discussion, instead of being a means employed
to gain an object, is the end itself.</p>

<p>The orator, if such a name is to be so degraded,
rises not to gain the votes of his hearers, but to make
them laugh and clap their hands; and, this is most
easily done by advancing smart sophisms, and uttering
well-delivered absurdities with mock solemnity,
we may readily conceive how little the powers of
investigation can be exercised and improved by such
practice as that of spouting clubs and debating
societies. No doubt there are many exceptions to
these remarks, but the vice we complain of is, we
fear, inherent in some degree in the nature of the
institutions, although by care in the choice of members,
and the selection of an audience, it may, in a
great measure, be counteracted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>We must not forget to state the advantages
enjoyed by the Teacher's attendance on the sittings
of our Committees. He becomes most intimately acquainted
with the minds of his pupils. He sees their
difficulties and their errors in a strong light, and is
placed in a situation for addressing himself more
completely to the state of their wants than he could
be, unless they were thus induced, and almost compelled,
to disclose all the workings of the mental
machine. In general, nearly every person who
knows a boy at all, has an opportunity of becoming
better acquainted with him than his instructor. No
wonder, considering the many painful sensations
which the latter, in his various offices of accuser,
witness, judge and executioner, is compelled to exite.
We are happily relieved from these difficulties, but
we still seize with avidity every means by which our
pupils may be induced to develop their minds to our
view, feeling that our acquaintance with their springs
of thought and action can never be too accurate and
complete. The votes at the conclusion of the debate
show us the measure of our success. Every influence
except that of mind, is, we trust, out of the question:
we do not always carry a majority with us; and this
fact gives us hope, that when we do, a sincere effect
has been wrought on the convictions of the boys.</p>

<p>To conclude, we must in candour acknowledge,
that we search more industriously for arguments and
illustrations to support our opinions, than we should
or <i>could</i> do, under other circumstances. The effect
on the mind of the Master is not a bad test of any
method of education.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But now to my hero. If many a forgotten
writer, or writer destined to be forgotten, is on that
account the more deserving of applause for having
spared no cost of toil and intellectual exertion upon
his works, certainly Swedenborg of all such writers is
deserving of the most. Without doubt his flask in
the moon is full; and not at all less than any of those
which Ariosto saw in that planet filled with the lost
wits of men, so thoroughly is his great work emptied
of every drop of common sense. Nevertheless there
prevails in every part so wonderful an agreement with
all that the most refined and consistent sense under
the same fantastic delusions could produce on the
same subject, that the reader will pardon me if I
here detect the same curiosities in the caprices of
fancy which many other virtuosi have detected in the
caprices of nature; for instance, in variegated marble,
where some have discovered a holy family; or in
stalactites and petrifactions, where others have discovered
monks, baptismal fonts, and organs; or even
in frozen window-panes, where our countryman
Liscow, the humourist, discovered the number of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>beast and the triple crown; things which he only is
apt to descry, whose head is preoccupied with thoughts
about them.</p>

<p>The main work of this writer is composed of eight
quarto volumes full of nonsense, which he presented
to the world as a new revelation under the title of
<i>Arcana C&oelig;lestia</i>. In this work his visions are chiefly
directed to the discovery of the secret sense in the
two first books of Moses, and to a similar way of
interpreting the whole of the Scripture. All these
fantastic interpretations are nothing to my present
purpose: those who have any curiosity may find some
account of them in the <i>Bibliotheca Theologica</i> of Dr.
Ernesti. All that I design to extract are his <i>audita
et visa</i>, from the supplements to his chapters&mdash;that
which he saw with his own eyes, and heard with his
own ears: for these parts of his dreams it is which
are to be considered as the foundation of all the rest.
Swedenborg's style is dull and mean. His narrations
and their whole contexture appear in fact to have
originated in a disorder of his sensitive faculty, and
suggest no reason for suspecting that the speculative
delusions of a depraved intellect have moved him to
invent them. Viewed in this light, they are really
of some importance&mdash;and deserve to be exhibited in
a short abstract; much more indeed than many a
brainless product of fantastic philosophers who swell
our journals with false subtilties; for a coherent
delusion of the senses is always a more remarkable
phenomenon than a delusion of the intellect; inasmuch
as the grounds of this latter delusion are well
known, and the delusion itself corrigible enough by
self-exertion and by putting more check upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>rash precipitation of the judgment; whereas a delusion
of the senses touches the original foundation
of all judgment, and where it exists is radically
incapable of all cure from logic. I distinguish therefore
in our author his craziness of sense from his
crazy wits; and I pass over his absurd and distorted
reasonings in those parts where he abandons his
visions, for the same reason that in reading a philosopher
we are often obliged to separate his observations
from his arguments: and generally, delusive
experiences are more instructive than delusive grounds
of experience in the reason. Whilst I thus rob the
reader of some few moments, which otherwise perhaps
he would have spent with no greater profit in reading
works of abstract philosophy that are often of not
less trivial import,&mdash;I have at the same time provided
for the delicacy of his taste by the omission of many
chim&aelig;ras, and by concentrating the essence of the
book into a few drops; and for this I anticipate no
less gratitude from him than (according to the old
story) a patient expressed towards his physicians&mdash;who
had contented themselves with ordering him to
eat the bark of the quinquina, when it was clearly in
their power to have insisted on his eating up the
whole tree.</p>

<p>Mr. Swedenborg divides his visions into three kinds,
of which the first consists in being liberated from the
body&mdash;an intermediate state between waking and
sleeping, in which he saw&mdash;heard&mdash;and felt spirits.
This kind he has experienced three or four times.
The second consists in being carried away by spirits,
whilst he continues to walk the streets (suppose)
without losing his way; meantime in spirit he is in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>quite other regions, and sees distinctly houses, men,
forests, &amp;c.; and all this for some hours long, until
he suddenly finds himself again in his true place.
This has happened to him two or three times. The
third or ordinary kind of visions is that which he
has daily when wide awake; and from this class his
narrations are chiefly taken. All men, according to
Swedenborg, stand in an intimate connection with the
spiritual world; only they are not aware of it; and
the difference between himself and others consists
simply in this&mdash;that his innermost nature is laid
open, of which gift he always speaks with the most
devout spirit of gratitude (Datum mihi est ex divin&acirc;
Domini misericordi&acirc;). From the context it is apparent
that this gift consists in the consciousness of
those obscure representations which the soul receives
through its continual connection with the spiritual
world. Accordingly he distinguishes in men between
the external and the internal memory. The former
he enjoys as a person who belongs to the visible world,
but the latter in virtue of his intercourse with the
spiritual world. Upon this distinction is grounded
also the distinction between the outer and inner man;
and Swedenborg's prerogative consists in this&mdash;that
he stands already in this life in the society of spirits,
and is recognised by them as possessing such a prerogative.
In the inner memory is retained whatsoever
has vanished from the outer; and of all which is
presented to the consciousness of man nothing is ever
lost. After death the remembrance of all which ever
entered his soul, and even all that had perished to
himself, constitutes the entire book of his life. The
presence of spirits, it is true, strikes only upon his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>inner sense. Nevertheless this is able to excite an
apparition of these spirits external to himself, and
even to invest them with a human figure. The
language of spirits is an <i>immediate</i> and unsymbolic
communication of ideas; notwithstanding which it is
always clothed in the semblance of that language
which Swedenborg himself speaks, and is represented
as external to him. One spirit reads in the memory
of another spirit all the representations, whether
images or ideas, which it contains. Thus the spirits see
in Swedenborg all the representations which he has
of this world; and with so clear an intuition that
they often deceive themselves and fancy that they see
the objects themselves immediately&mdash;which however
is impossible, since no pure spirit has the slightest
perception of the material universe: nay they cannot
gain any idea of it through intercourse with the souls
of other living men, because their inner nature is not
opened&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> their inner sense contains none but
obscure representations. Hence it arises that Mr.
Swedenborg is the true oracle of spirits, which are
not at all less curious to read in him the present
condition of the world, than he is to view in their
memory, as in a mirror, the marvels of the spiritual
world. Although these spirits stand in like manner
closely connected with all other souls of living men,
by a reciprocal commerce of action and passion, yet
they are as little aware of this as men are aware of
it. Spirits therefore ascribe to themselves as the
product of their own minds what in fact results from
the action of human souls upon them; just as men
during their lives imagine that all their thoughts,
and the motions of the will which take place within
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>them, arise from themselves, although in fact they
oftentimes take their origin in the spiritual world.
Meantime every human soul, even in this life, has its
place and station in this spiritual world, and belongs
to a certain society which is always adapted to its
inner condition of truth and goodness,&mdash;that is, to
the condition of the understanding and the will. But
the places of souls in relation to each other have
nothing in common with the material world; and
therefore the soul of a man in India is often in
respect to spiritual situation next neighbour to the
soul of another man in Europe; as on the contrary
very often those, who dwell corporeally under the
same roof, are with respect to their spiritual relations
far enough asunder. If a man dies, his soul does not
on that account change its place; but simply feels
itself in that place which in regard to other spirits it
already held in this life. For the rest, although the
relation of spirits to each other is no true relation of
space, yet has it to them the appearance of space;
and their affinities or attractions for each other assume
the semblance of proximities, as their repulsions do
of distances; just as spirits themselves are not
actually extended, but yet present the appearance to
each other of a human figure. In this imaginary
space there is an undisturbed intercourse of spiritual
natures. Mr. Swedenborg converses with departed
souls whenever he chooses, and reads in their memory
(he means to say in their representative faculty) that
very condition in which they contemplate themselves;
and this he sees as clearly as with his bodily eyes.
Moreover the enormous distance of the rational inhabitants
of the world is to be accounted as nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>in relation to the spiritual universe; and to talk with
an inhabitant of Saturn is just as easy to him as to
speak with a departed human soul. All depends
upon the relation of their inner condition in reference
to their agreement in truth and goodness: but those
spirits, which have weak affinities for each other, can
readily come into intercourse through the inter-agency
of others. On this account it is not necessary that a
man should actually have dwelt on all the other
heavenly bodies in order to know them together with
all their wonders.</p>

<p>One presiding doctrine in Swedenborg's ravings is
this: corporeal beings have no subsistence of their
own, but exist merely by and through the spiritual
world; although each body not by means of one
spirit alone, but of all taken together. Hence the
knowledge of material things has two meanings; an
external meaning referring to the inter-dependencies
of the matter upon itself, and an internal meaning in
so far as they denote the powers of the spiritual world
which are their causes. Thus the body of man has a
system of parts related to each other agreeably to
material laws: but, in so far as it is supported by
the spirit which lives, its limbs and their functions
have a symbolic value as expressions of those faculties
in the soul from which they derive their form, mode
of activity, and power of enduring. The same law
holds with regard to all other things in the visible
universe: they have (as has been said) one meaning
as things&mdash;which is trivial, and another as signs&mdash;which
is far weightier. Hence by the way arises the
source of those new interpretations of Scripture which
Swedenborg has introduced. For the inner sense,&mdash;that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>is, the symbolic relation of all things there
recorded to the spiritual world,&mdash;is, as he conceits,
the kernel of its value; all the rest being only its
shell. All spirits represent themselves to one another
under the appearance of extended forms; and the
influences of all these spiritual beings amongst one
another raise to them at the same time appearances
of other extended beings, and as it were of a material
world. Swedenborg therefore speaks of gardens&mdash;spacious
regions&mdash;mansions&mdash;galleries&mdash;and arcades
of spirits&mdash;as of things seen by himself in the clearest
light; and he assures us&mdash;that, having many times
conversed with all his friends after their death, he
had almost always found in those who had but lately
died&mdash;that they could scarcely convince themselves
that they had died, because they saw round about
them a world similar to the one they had quitted.
He found also that spiritual societies, which had the
same inner condition, had the same apparition of
space and of all things in space; and that the change
of their internal state was always accompanied by
the appearance of a change of place.</p>

<p>I have already noticed that, according to our
author, the various powers and properties of the soul
stand in sympathy with the organs of the body
entrusted to its government. The outer man therefore
corresponds to the whole inner man; and hence,
whenever any remarkable spiritual influence from the
invisible world reaches one of these faculties of the
soul, he is sensible also harmonically of the apparent
presence of it in the corresponding members of his
outer man. To this head now he refers a vast variety
of sensations in his body which are uniformly connected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>with spiritual intuition; but the absurdity of
them is so enormous that I shall not attempt to
adduce even a single instance.&mdash;&mdash;By all this a preparation
is made for the strangest and most fantastic
of his notions in which all his ravings are blended.
As different powers and faculties constitute that
unity which is the soul or inner man, so also different
spirits (whose leading characteristics bear the same
relation to each other as the various faculties of a
spirit) constitute one society which exhibits the
appearance of one great man; and in this shadowy
image every spirit is seen in that place and in those
visible members which are agreeable to its proper
function in such a spiritual body. And all spiritual
societies taken together, and the entire universe of
all these invisible beings, appears again in the form
of a hugest and ultra-enormous man mountain: a
monstrous and gigantic fancy, which perhaps has
grown out of the school mode of representing a whole
quarter of the world under the image of a virgin
sitting. In this immeasurable man is an entire and
inner commerce of each spirit with all, and of all with
each; and, let the position of men in reference to
each other be what it may, they take quite another
position in this enormous man&mdash;a position which they
never change, and which is only in appearance a local
position in an immeasurable space, but in fact a
determinate kind of relation and influence.</p>

<p>But I am weary of transcribing the delirious ravings
of a poor visionary, the craziest that has ever existed,
or of pursuing them to his descriptions of the state
after death. I am checked also by other considerations.
For, although in forming a medical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>museum it is right to collect specimens not only of
natural but also of unnatural productions and
abortions, yet it is necessary to be cautious before
whom you show them: and amongst my readers
there may happen to be some in a crazy condition of
nerves; and it would give me pain to think that I
had been the occasion of any mischief to them.
Having warned them however from the beginning, I
am not responsible for anything that may happen;
and must desire that no person will lay at my door
the moon-calves which may chance to arise from any
teeming fancy impregnated by Mr. Swedenborg's
revelations.</p>

<p>In conclusion I have to say that I have not interpolated
my author's dreams with any surreptitious
ones of my own; but have laid a faithful abstract
before the economic reader, who might not be well
pleased to pay seven pounds sterling for a body of
raving. I have indeed omitted many circumstantial
pictures of his intuitions, because they could only
have served to disturb the reader's slumber; and the
confused sense of his revelations I have now and then
clothed in a more current diction. But all the
important features of the sketch I have preserved in
their native integrity.&mdash;And thus I return with
some little shame from my foolish labours, from
which I shall draw this moral: That it is often a
very easy thing to act prudentially; but alas! too
often only after we have toiled to our prudence
through a forest of delusions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">[<i>In a Letter to an American Gentleman.</i>]</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>My dear L,&mdash;Among the <i>lions</i> whom you missed
by one accident or another on your late travels in
Europe, I observe that you recur to none with so much
regret as Professor Wilson; you dwell upon this one
disappointment as a personal misfortune; and perhaps
with reason; for, in the course of my life, I have met
with no man of equally varied accomplishments, or,
upon the whole, so well entitled to be ranked with
that order of men distinguished by brilliant versatility
and ambidexterity&mdash;of which order we find such
eminent models in Alcibiades, in C&aelig;sar, in Crichton,
in that of Servan recorded by Sully, and in one or
two Italians. Pity that you had not earlier communicated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>to me the exact route you were bound to, and
the particular succession of your engagements when
you visited the English Lakes; since, in that case,
my interest with Professor Wilson (supposing always
that you had declined to rely upon the better passport
of your own merits as a naturalist) would have
availed for a greater thing than at that time stood
between you and the introduction which you coveted.
On the day, or the night rather, when you were at
Bowness and Ambleside, I happen to know that
Professor Wilson's business was one which might
have been executed by proxy, though it could not be
delayed; and I also know that, apart from the
<i>general</i> courtesy of his nature, he would, at all times,
have an especial pleasure in waiving a claim of business
for one of science or letters, in the person of a
foreigner coming from a great distance; and that in
no other instance would he make such a sacrifice so
cordially as on behalf of an able naturalist. Perhaps
you already know from your countryman, Audubon,
that the Professor is himself a naturalist, and of
original merit; in fact, worth a score of such meagre
bookish naturalists as are formed in museums and by
second-hand acts of memory; having (like Audubon)
built much of his knowledge upon personal observation.
Hence he has two great advantages: one, that
his knowledge is accurate in a very unusual degree;
and another, that this knowledge, having grown up
under the inspiration of a real interest and an unaffected
love for its objects,&mdash;commencing, indeed, at
an age when no affectation in matters of that nature
could exist,&mdash;has settled upon those facts and circumstances
which have a true philosophical value: habits,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>predominant affections, the direction of instincts, and
the compensatory processes where these happen to be
thwarted,&mdash;on all such topics he is learned and full;
whilst, on the science of measurements and proportions,
applied to dorsal-fins and tail-feathers, and on
the exact arrangement of colours, &amp;c.&mdash;that petty upholstery
of nature, on which books are so tedious and
elaborate,&mdash;not uncommonly he is negligent or forgetful.
What may have served in later years to quicken
and stimulate his knowledge in this field, and, at any
rate, greatly to extend it, is the conversation of his
youngest brother, Mr. James Wilson, who (as <i>you</i>
know much better than I) is a naturalist <i>majorum
gentium</i>. He, indeed, whilst a boy of not more than
sixteen or seventeen, was in correspondence (I believe)
with Montague the Ornithologist; and about the
same time had skill enough to pick holes in the coat
of Mr. H&uuml;ber, the German reformer of our then
erroneous science of bees.</p>

<p>You see, therefore, that no possible introduction
could have stood you more in stead than your own
extensive knowledge of transatlantic ornithology.
Swammerdam passed his life, it is said, in a ditch.
<i>That</i> was a base, earthy solitude,&mdash;and a prison. But
you and Audubon have passed <i>your</i> lives in the
heavenly solitudes of forests and savannahs; and
such solitude as this is no prison, but infinite liberty.
The knowledge which you have gathered has been
answerable to the character of your school: and no
sort of knowledge could have secured you a better
welcome with Professor Wilson. Yet, had it been
otherwise, I repeat that my interest (as I flatter
myself) would have opened the gates of Elleray to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>you even at midnight; for I am so old a friend of
Mr. Wilson that I take a pride in supposing myself
the oldest; and, barring relations by blood, arrogate
the rights of dean in the chapter of his associates:
or at least I know of but one person whose title can
probably date earlier than mine. About this very
month when I am writing, I have known Professor
Wilson for a cycle of twenty years and more, which
is just half of his life&mdash;and also half of mine; for
we are almost <i>ad apicem</i> of the same age; Wilson
being born in May, and I in August, of the same
memorable year.</p>

<p>My introduction to him&mdash;setting apart the introduc<i>ee</i>
himself&mdash;was memorable from one sole circumstance,
viz. the person of the introducer. <i>William
Wordsworth</i> it was, who in the vale of Grasmere, if it
can interest you to know the place, and in the latter
end of 1808, if you can be supposed to care about the
time, did me the favour of making me known to John
Wilson, or as I might say (upon the Scottish fashion
of designating men from their territorial pretensions)
to Elleray. I remember the whole scene as circumstantially
as if it belonged to but yesterday. In the
vale of Grasmere,&mdash;that peerless little vale which you
and Gray the poet and so many others have joined in
admiring as the very Eden of English beauty, peace,
and pastoral solitude,&mdash;you may possibly recall, even
from that flying glimpse you had of it, a modern
house called Allan Bank, standing under a low screen
of woody rocks which descend from the hill of Silver
How, on the western side of the lake. This house had
been then recently built by a worthy merchant of
Liverpool; but for some reason of no importance to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>you and me, not being immediately wanted for the
family of the owner, had been let for a term of three
years to Mr. Wordsworth. At the time I speak of,
both Mr. Coleridge and myself were on a visit to Mr.
Wordsworth; and one room on the ground floor, designed
for a breakfasting-room, which commands a
sublime view of the three mountains,&mdash;Fairfield,
Arthur's Chair, and Seat Sandal (the first of them
within about four hundred feet of the highest mountains
in Great Britain), was then occupied by Mr.
Coleridge as a study. On this particular day, the sun
having only just set, it naturally happened that Mr.
Coleridge&mdash;whose nightly vigils were long&mdash;had not
yet come down to breakfast: meantime, and until the
epoch of the Coleridgian breakfast should arrive, his
study was lawfully disposable to profaner uses. Here,
therefore, it was, that, opening the door hastily in
quest of a book, I found seated, and in earnest conversation,
two gentlemen&mdash;one of them my host, Mr.
Wordsworth, at that time about thirty-seven or
thirty-eight years old; the other was a younger man
by good sixteen or seventeen years, in a sailor's dress,
manifestly in robust health&mdash;<i>fervidus juvent&acirc;</i>, and
wearing upon his countenance a powerful expression
of ardour and animated intelligence, mixed with much
good nature. <i>'Mr. Wilson of Elleray'</i>&mdash;delivered, as
the formula of introduction, in the deep tones of Mr.
Wordsworth&mdash;at once banished the momentary surprise
I felt on finding an unknown stranger where I
had expected nobody, and substituted a surprise of
another kind: I now well understood who it was that
I saw; and there was no wonder in his being at
Allan Bank, Elleray standing within nine miles; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
(as usually happens in such cases) I felt a shock of
surprise on seeing a person so little corresponding to
the one I had half unconsciously prefigured.</p>

<p>And here comes the place naturally, if anywhere,
for a description of Mr. Wilson's person and general
appearance in carriage, manner, and deportment; and
a word or two I shall certainly say on these points,
simply because I know that I <i>must</i>, else my American
friends will complain that I have left out that precise
section in my whole account which it is most impossible
for them to supply for themselves by any
acquaintance with his printed works. Yet suffer me,
before I comply with this demand, to enter one word
of private protest against the childish (nay, worse
than childish&mdash;the <i>missy</i>) spirit in which such demands
originate. From my very earliest years,&mdash;that is the
earliest years in which I had any sense of what
belongs to true dignity of mind,&mdash;I declare to you
that I have considered the interest which men, grown
men, take in the personal appearance of each other
as one of the meanest aspects under which human
curiosity commonly presents itself. Certainly I
have the same intellectual perception of differences
in such things that other men have; but I connect
none of the feelings, whether of admiration or
contempt, liking or disliking, which are obviously
connected with these perceptions by human beings
generally. Such words as 'commanding appearance,'
'prepossessing countenance,' applied to the figures or
faces of the males of the human species, have no
meaning in my ears: no man commands me, no man
prepossesses me, by anything in, on, or about his
carcass. What care I for any man's legs? I laugh
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>at his ridiculous presumption in conceiting that I shall
trouble myself to admire or to respect anything that
he can produce in his <i>physics</i>. What! shall I honour
Milo for the very qualities which he has in common
with the beastly ox he carries&mdash;his thews and sinews,
his ponderous strength and weight, and the quantity
of thumping that his hide will carry? I disclaim and
disdain any participation in such green-girl feelings.
I admit that the baby feelings I am here condemning
are found in connection with the highest intellects:
in particular, Mr. Coleridge for instance once said to
me, as a justifying reason for his dislike of a certain
celebrated Scotsman, with an air of infinite disgust,&mdash;'that
ugh!' (making a guttural sound as if of execration)
'he (viz. the said Scotsman) was so chicken-breasted.'
I have been assured by the way, that Mr.
Coleridge was mistaken in the mere matter of fact:
but supposing that he were not, what a reason for
a philosopher to build a disgust upon! And Mr.
Wordsworth, in or about the year 1820, in expressing
the extremity of his <i>Nil admirari</i> spirit, declared that
he would not go ten yards out of his road to see the
finest specimen of man (intellectually speaking) that
Europe had to show: and so far indeed I do not
quarrel with his opinion; but Mr. Wordsworth went
on to say that this indifference did <i>not</i> extend itself
to man considered physically; and that he would still
exert himself to a small extent (suppose a mile or so)
for the sake of seeing Belzoni. <i>That</i> was the case he
instanced: and, as I understood him, not by way of
a general illustration for his meaning, but that he
really felt an exclusive interest in this particular
man's <i>physics</i>. Now Belzoni was certainly a good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>tumbler, as I have heard; and hopped well upon one
leg, when surmounted and crested by a pyramid of
men and boys; and jumped capitally through a hoop;
and did all sorts of tricks in all sorts of styles, not at
all worse than any monkey, bear, or learned pig, that
ever exhibited in Great Britain. And I would myself
have given a shilling to have seen him fight with
that cursed Turk that assaulted him in the streets of
Cairo; and would have given him a crown for catching
the circumcised dog by the throat and effectually
taking the conceit out of his Mahometan carcass: but
then <i>that</i> would have been for the spectacle of the
passions, which, in such a case, would have been let
loose: as to the mere animal Belzoni,&mdash;who after all
was not to be compared to Topham the Warwickshire
man, that drew back by main force a cart, and its
driver, and a strong horse,&mdash;as to the mere animal
Belzoni, I say, and his bull neck, I would have much
preferred to see a real bull or the Darlington ox. The
sum of the matter is this: all men, even those who
are most manly in their style of thinking and feeling,
in many things retain the childishness of their
childish years: no man thoroughly weeds himself of
all. And this particular mode of childishness is one
of the commonest, into which they fall the more
readily from the force of sympathy, and because they
apprehend no reason for directing any vigilance
against it. But I contend that reasonably no feelings
of deep interest are justifiable as applied to any point
of external form or feature in human beings, unless
under two reservations: first, that they shall have
reference to women; because women, being lawfully
the objects of passions and tender affections, which can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>have no existence as applied to men, are objects also,
rationally and consistently, of all other secondary
feelings (such as those derived from their personal
appearance) which have any tendency to promote and
support the first. Whereas between men the highest
mode of intercourse is merely intellectual, which is
not of a nature to receive support or strength from
any feelings of pleasure or disgust connected with the
accidents of external appearance: but exactly in the
degree in which these have any influence at all they
must warp and disturb by improper biases; and the
single case of exception, where such feelings can be
honourable and laudable amongst the males of the
human species, is where they regard such deformities
as are the known products and expressions of criminal
or degrading propensities. All beyond this, I care
not by whom countenanced, is infirmity of mind, and
would be baseness if it were not excused by imbecility.</p>

<p>Excuse this digression, for which I have a double
reason: chiefly I was anxious to put on record my
own opinions, and my contempt for men generally in
this particular; and here I seemed to have a conspicuous
situation for that purpose. Secondly, apart
from this purpose of offence, I was at any rate
anxious, merely on a defensive principle, to screen
myself from the obvious misinterpretation incident
to the case: saying anything minute or in detail upon
a man's person, I should necessarily be supposed to
do so under the ordinary blind feelings of interest in
that subject which govern most people; feelings
which I disdain. Now, having said all this, and
made my formal protest, <i>liberavi animam meam</i>; and
I revert to my subject, and shall say that word or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>two which I was obliged to promise you on Professor
Wilson's personal appearance.</p>

<p>Figure to yourself, then, a tall man, about six feet
high, within half an inch or so, built with tolerable
appearance of strength; but at the date of my
description (that is, in the very spring-tide and
blossom of youth) wearing, for the predominant
character of his person, lightness and agility, or (in
our Westmoreland phrase), <i>lishness</i>: he seemed framed
with an express view to gymnastic exercises of every
sort&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&#913;&#955;&#956;&#945;, &#960;&#959;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#951;&#957;, &#948;&#953;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#957;, &#945;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;, &#960;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#957;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the first of these exercises, indeed, and possibly
(but of that I am not equally certain) in the second,
I afterwards came to know that he was absolutely
unrivalled: and the best leapers at that time in the
ring, Richmond the Black and others, on getting 'a
taste of his quality,' under circumstances of considerable
disadvantage [viz. after a walk from Oxford
to Moulsey Hurst, which I believe is fifty miles],
declined to undertake him. For this exercise he had
two remarkable advantages: it is recorded of Sheffield,
Duke of Buckingham, that, though otherwise a
handsome man, he offended the connoisseurs in
statuesque proportions by one eminent defect&mdash;perhaps
the most obtrusive to which the human
figure is liable&mdash;viz. a body of length disproportioned
to his legs. In Mr. Wilson the proportions were
fortunately reversed: a short trunk, and remarkably
long legs, gave him one half of his advantages in the
noble science of leaping; the other half was afterwards
pointed out to me by an accurate critic in these
matters as lying in the particular conformation of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>his foot, the instep of which is arched, and the back
of the heel strengthened in so remarkable a way that
it would be worth paying a penny or so for a sight of
them. It is really laughable to think of the coxcombry
which eminent men of letters have displayed
in connection with their powers&mdash;real or fancied&mdash;in
this art. Cardinal du Perron vapoured to the end of
his life upon some remarkable leap that he either <i>had</i>
accomplished, or conceived himself to have accomplished
(not, I presume, in red stockings). Every
tenth page of the <i>Perroniana</i> rings with the echo of
this stupendous leap&mdash;the length of which, if I remember
rightly, is as obviously fabulous as any feat
of Don Belianis of Greece. Des Cartes also had a
lurking conceit that, in some unknown place, he had
perpetrated a leap that ought to immortalise him;
and in one of his letters he repeats and accredits a
story of some obscure person's leap, which</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'At one light bound high overleaped all bound'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>of reasonable credulity. Many other eminent leapers
might be cited, Pagan and Christian: but the Cardinal,
by his own account, appears to have been the flower
of Popish leapers; and, with all deference to his
Eminence, upon a better assurance than that, Professor
Wilson may be rated, at the time I speak of,
as the flower of all Protestant leapers. Not having
the Cardinal's foible of connecting any vanity with
this little accomplishment, knowing exactly what
could and what could <i>not</i> be effected in this department
of gymnastics, and speaking with the utmost
simplicity and candour of his failures and his successes
alike, he might always be relied upon, and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>statements were constantly in harmony with any collateral
testimony that chance happened to turn up.</p>

<p>Viewed, therefore, by an eye learned in gymnastic
proportions, Mr. Wilson presented a somewhat striking
figure: and by some people he was pronounced
with emphasis a fine looking young man; but others,
who less understood, or less valued these advantages,
spoke of him as nothing extraordinary. Still greater
division of voices I have heard on his pretensions to
be thought handsome. In my opinion, and most
certainly in his own, these pretensions were but
slender. His complexion was too florid; hair of a
hue quite unsuited to that complexion; eyes not good,
having no apparent depth, but seeming mere surfaces;
and in fine, no one feature that could be called fine,
except the lower region of his face, mouth, chin, and
the parts adjacent, which were then (and perhaps are
now) truly elegant and Ciceronian. Ask in one of
your public libraries for that little 4to edition of the
<i>Rhetorical Works of Cicero</i>, edited by Sch&uuml;tz (the same
who edited <i>&AElig;schylus</i>), and you will there see (as a
frontispiece to the 1st vol.) a reduced whole length of
Cicero from the antique; which in the mouth and
chin, and indeed generally, if I do not greatly forget,
will give you a lively representation of the contour
and expression of Professor Wilson's face. Taken as
a whole, though not handsome (as I have already
said), when viewed in a quiescent state, the head and
countenance are massy, dignified, and expressive of
tranquil sagacity.</p>

<p>Thus far of Professor Wilson in his outward man,
whom (to gratify you and yours, and upon the consideration
that my letter is to cross the Atlantic), I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>have described with an effort and a circumstantiation
that are truly terrific to look back upon. And now,
returning to the course of my narrative, such in
personal appearance was the young man upon whom
my eyes suddenly rested, for the first time, upwards
of twenty years ago, in the study of S. T. Coleridge&mdash;looking,
as I said before, light as a Mercury to eyes
familiar with the British build; but, with reference
to the lengthy model of you Yankees, who spindle up
so tall and narrow, already rather bulky and columnar.
Note, however, that of all this array of personal
features, as I have here described them, I then saw
nothing at all, my attention being altogether occupied
with Mr. Wilson's conversation and demeanour, which
were in the highest degree agreeable: the points
which chiefly struck me being the humility and
gravity with which he spoke of himself, his large
expansion of heart, and a certain air of noble frankness
which overspread everything he said; he seemed
to have an intense enjoyment of life; indeed, being
young, rich, healthy, and full of intellectual activity,
it could not be very wonderful that he should feel
happy and pleased with himself and others; but it
was somewhat unusual to find that so rare an assemblage
of endowments had communicated no tinge of
arrogance to his manner, or at all disturbed the
general temperance of his mind.</p>

<p>Turn we now suddenly, and without preparation,&mdash;simply
by way of illustrating the versatile humour of
the man,&mdash;from this grave and (as in reality it was)
philosophic scene, to another first introduction, under
most different circumstances, to the same Mr. Wilson.
Represent to yourself the earliest dawn of a fine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>summer morning, time about half-past two o'clock.
A young man, anxious for an introduction to Mr.
Wilson, and as yet pretty nearly a stranger to the
country, has taken up his abode in Grasmere, and
has strolled out at this early hour to that rocky and
moorish common (called the White Moss) which overhangs
the Vale of Rydal, dividing it from Grasmere.
Looking southwards in the direction of Rydal, suddenly
he becomes aware of a huge beast advancing at
a long trot with the heavy and thundering tread of a
hippopotamus along the public road. The creature is
soon arrived within half a mile of his station; and by
the gray light of morning is at length made out to be
a bull apparently flying from some unseen enemy in
his rear. As yet, however, all is mystery; but suddenly
three horsemen double a turn in the road, and
come flying into sight with the speed of a hurricane,
manifestly in pursuit of the fugitive bull; the bull
labours to navigate his huge bulk to the moor, which
he reaches, and then pauses, panting and blowing out
clouds of smoke from his nostrils, to look back from
his station amongst rocks and slippery crags upon his
hunters. If he had conceited that the rockiness of
the ground had secured his repose, the foolish bull is
soon undeceived; the horsemen, scarcely relaxing
their speed, charge up the hill, and speedily gaining
the rear of the bull, drive him at a gallop over the
worst part of that impracticable ground down into
the level ground below. At this point of time the
stranger perceives by the increasing light of the
morning that the hunters are armed with immense
spears fourteen feet long. With these the bull is
soon dislodged, and scouring down to the plain below,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>he and the hunters at his tail take to the common at
the head of the lake, and all, in the madness of the
chase, are soon half engulfed in the swamps of the
morass. After plunging together for ten or fifteen
minutes, all suddenly regain the <i>terra firma</i>, and the
bull again makes for the rocks. Up to this moment
there had been the silence of ghosts; and the stranger
had doubted whether the spectacle were not a pageant
of a&euml;rial spectres, ghostly huntsmen; ghostly lances,
and a ghostly bull. But just at this crisis&mdash;a voice
(it was the voice of Mr. Wilson) shouted aloud, 'Turn
the villain; turn that villain; or he will take to
Cumberland.' The young stranger did the service
required of him; the villain was turned and fled
southwards; the hunters, lance in rest, rushed after
him; all bowed their thanks as they fled past him;
the fleet cavalcade again took the high road; they
doubled the cape which shut them out of sight; and
in a moment all had disappeared and left the quiet
valley to its original silence, whilst the young stranger
and two grave Westmoreland statesmen (who by this
time had come into sight upon some accident or other)
stood wondering in silence, and saying to themselves,
perhaps,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The earth hath bubbles as the water hath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these are of them!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But they were no bubbles; the bull was a substantial
bull; and took no harm at all from being
turned out occasionally at midnight for a chase of
fifteen or eighteen miles. The bull, no doubt, used
to wonder at this nightly visitation; and the owner
of the bull must sometimes have pondered a little on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>the draggled state in which the swamps would now
and then leave his beast; but no other harm came of
it. And so it happened, and in the very hurly burly
of such an unheard-of chase, that my friend was
fortunate enough, by a little service, to recommend
himself to the notice of Mr. Wilson; and so passed
the scene of his <i>first introduction</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>In reading the anecdote of the bull hunt, you must
bear in mind the period of Mr. Wilson's life to which
it belongs, else I should here be unintentionally
adding one more to the thousand misrepresentations
of his character, which are already extant in different
repositories of scandal: most of which I presume,
unless in the rarer cases where they have been the
pure creations of malice, owe their origin to a little
exaggeration, and a great deal of confusion in dates.
Levities and extravagances, which find a ready excuse
at twenty, ten or fifteen years later are fatal to a
man's character for good sense. In such a case,
therefore, to be careless or inaccurate in dates, is a
moral dishonesty. Understand then that the bull-hunting
scenes belong to the time which immediately
succeeded my first knowledge of Mr. Wilson. This
particular frolic happened to fall within the earliest
period of my own personal acquaintance with him.
Else, and with this one exception, the era of his
wildest (and according to the common estimate, of
his insane) extravagances was already past. All those
stories, therefore, which you question me about with
so much curiosity, of his having joined a company of
strolling players, and himself taken the leading parts
both in Tragedy and Comedy&mdash;of his having assumed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>the garb of a Gipsy, and settled for some time in a
Gipsy encampment, out of admiration for a young
Egyptian beauty; with fifty others of the same class,
belong undoubtedly (as many of them as are not
wholly fabulous), to the four years immediately preceding
the time at which my personal knowledge of
Mr. Wilson commenced.</p>

<p>From the latter end of 1803 to the spring of 1808,
Mr. Wilson had studied at the University of Oxford;
and it was within that period that most of his <i>escapades</i>
were crowded. He had previously studied as a
mere boy, according to the Scotch fashion, at the
University of Glasgow, chiefly under the tuition of
the late Mr. Jardine (the Professor, I believe, of
Logic), and Dr. or Mr. Young (the Professor of
Greek). At both Universities he had greatly distinguished
himself; but at Oxford, where the distribution
of prizes and honours of every kind is to the last
degree parsimonious and select, naturally it follows
that such academical distinctions are really <i>significant</i>
distinctions, and proclaim an unequivocal merit in
him who has carried them off from a crowd of 1600
or 2000 co-rivals, to whom the contest was open;
whereas, in the Scotch Universities, as I am told by
Scotchmen, the multiplication of prizes and medals,
and the almost indiscriminate profusion with which
they are showered abroad, neutralises their whole
effect and value. At least this was the case in Mr.
Wilson's time; but lately some conspicuous changes
have been introduced by a Royal Commission (not
yet, I believe, dissolved) into one at least of the
Scotch Universities, which have greatly improved it
in this respect, by bringing it much nearer to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
English model. When Mr. Wilson gained a prize of
fifty guineas for fifty lines of English verse, without
further inquiry it becomes evident, from the mere
rarity of the distinction which, for a university <i>now</i>
nearly of five thousand members, occurs but once a year,
and from the great over-proportion of that peculiar
class (the Undergraduates) to whom the contest is
open,&mdash;that such a victory was an indisputable criterion
of very conspicuous merit. In fact, never in any
place did Mr. Wilson play off his Proteus variety of
character and talent with so much brilliant effect
as at Oxford. In this great University, the most
ancient, and by many degrees the most magnificent
in the world, he found a stage for display, perfectly congenial
with the native elevation of his own character.
Perhaps you are not fully aware of the characteristic
differences which separate our two English Universities
of Oxford and Cambridge from those of Scotland
and the Continent: for I have always observed
that the best informed foreigners, even after a week's
personal acquaintance with the Oxford system, still
adhere to the inveterate preconceptions which they
had brought with them from the Continent. For
instance, they continue obstinately to speak of the
<i>Professors</i> as the persons to whom the students are
indebted for tuition; whereas the majority of these
hold their offices as the most absolute sinecures, and
the task of tuition devolves upon the tutors appointed
in each particular college. These tutors are called
public tutors; meaning that they do not confine their
instructions to any one individual; but distribute
them amongst all the Undergraduates of the college
to which they belong; and, in addition to these,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
<i>private</i> tutors are allowed to any student who chooses
to increase his expenditure in that particular. But
the main distinction, which applies to our immediate
subject, is the more than regal provision for the
lodging and accommodation of the students by the
system of <i>Colleges</i>. Of these there are in Oxford,
neglecting the technical subdivision of <i>Halls</i>, five-and-twenty;
and the main use of all, both colleges and
halls, is, not as in Scotland and on the Continent, to
lodge the head of the University with suitable dignity,
and to provide rooms for the library and public business
of the University. These purposes are met by a
separate provision, distinct from the colleges; and the
colleges are applied as follows: 1st, and mainly to
the reception of the Fellows, and of the Undergraduate
Students; 2ndly, to the accommodation of
the head (known in different colleges by the several
designations of provost, principal, dean, rector, warden,
&amp;c.); 3rdly to the accommodation of the private library
attached to that college, and to the chapel, which is
used at least twice every day for public prayers;
4thly, to the Hall, and the whole establishment of
kitchen, wine vaults, buttery, &amp;c., &amp;c., which may be
supposed necessary for the liberal accommodation, at
the public meals of dinner [and in some colleges
supper] of gentlemen and visitors from the country,
or from the Continent; varying (we will suppose)
from 25 to 500 heads. Everywhere else the great
mass of the students are lodged in obscure nooks
and corners, which may or may not be respectable,
but are at all events withdrawn from the <i>surveillance</i>
of the University. I shall state both the ground and
the effect (or tendency rather) of this difference. Out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>of England, universities are not meant exclusively
for professional men; the sons of great landholders,
and a large proportion of the sons of noblemen, either
go through the same academic course as others&mdash;or a
shorter course adapted to their particular circumstances.
In England, again, the church is supplied
from the rank of gentry&mdash;not exclusively, it is true,
but in a much larger proportion than anywhere else,
except in Ireland. The corresponding ranks in Scotland,
from their old connection with France, have
adopted (I believe) much more of the Continental plan
for disposing of their sons at this period. At any rate,
it will not be contended by any man, that Scotland
throws anything like the same proportion with England,
of her gentry and her peerage into her universities.
Hence, a higher standard of manners and
of habits presides at Oxford and Cambridge; and, consequently,
a demand for much higher accommodations
would even <i>otherwise</i> have arisen, had not such a
demand already been supplied by the munificence of
our English princes and peers, both male and female;
and, in one instance at least, of a <i>Scottish</i> Prince
(Baliol). The extent of these vast Caravanseras
enables the governors of the various colleges to
furnish every student with a set of two rooms at
the least, often with a <i>suite</i> of three&mdash;[I, who lived at
Oxford on no more than my school allowance, had
that number]&mdash;or in many cases with far more. In
the superior colleges, indeed (superior, I mean, as to
their purse and landed endowments), all these accommodations
keep pace with the refinements of the age;
and thus a connection is maintained between the
University and the landed <i>Noblesse</i>&mdash;upper and lower&mdash;of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
England, which must be reciprocally beneficial,
and which, under other circumstances, could scarcely
have taken place.</p>

<p>Of these advantages, you may be sure, that Mr.
Wilson availed himself to the utmost extent. Instead
of going to <i>Baliol</i> College, he entered himself at
<i>Magdalen</i>, in the class of what are called, 'Gentlemen
Commoners.' All of us (you know) in Oxford
and Cambridge wear an Academic dress, which tells
at once our Academic rank with all its modifications.
And the term '<i>Gentlemen Commoner</i>' implies that he
has more splendid costumes, and more in number;
that he is expected to spend a good deal more money,
that he enjoys a few trifling immunities; and that he
has, in particular instances, something like a King's
right of pre-emption, as in the choice of rooms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Once launched in this orbit, Mr. Wilson continued
to blaze away for the four successive years, 1804,
1805, 1806, 1807, I believe without any intermission.
Possibly I myself was the one sole gownsman who
had not then found my attention fixed by his most
heterogeneous reputation. In a similar case, Cicero
tells a man that ignorance so unaccountable of another
man's pretensions argued himself to be a <i>homo
ignorabilis</i>; or, in the language of the Miltonic Satan,
'Not to know me, argues thyself unknown.' And
<i>that</i> is true; a <i>homo ignorabilis</i> most certainly I was.
And even with that admission it is still difficult to
account for the extent and the duration of my ignorance.
The fact is, that the case well expresses <i>both</i>
our positions; that <i>he</i> should be so conspicuous as to
challenge knowledge from the most sequestered of
anchorites expresses <i>his</i> life; that I should have right
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>to absolute ignorance of him who was familiar as daylight
to all the rest of Oxford&mdash;expresses <i>mine</i>. Never
indeed before, to judge from what I have since heard
upon inquiry, did a man, by variety of talents and
variety of humours, contrive to place himself as the
connecting link between orders of men so essentially
repulsive of each other&mdash;as Mr. Wilson in this instance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Omnis Aristippum decuit color et status, et res.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From the learned president of his college, Dr.
Routh, the editor of parts of <i>Plato</i>, and of some
<i>Theological Selections</i>, with whom Wilson enjoyed an
unlimited favour&mdash;from this learned Academic Doctor,
and many others of the same class, Wilson had an
infinite gamut of friends and associates, running
through every key; and the diapason closing full in
groom, cobbler, stable-boy, barber's apprentice, with
every shade and hue of blackguard and ruffian. In
particular, amongst this latter kind of worshipful
society, there was no man who had any talents&mdash;real
or fancied&mdash;for thumping or being thumped, but had
experienced some <i>preeing</i> of his merits from Mr.
Wilson. All other pretensions in the gymnastic arts
he took a pride in humbling or in honouring; but
chiefly his examinations fell upon pugilism; and not
a man, who could either 'give' or 'take,' but boasted
to have punished, or to have been punished by,
<i>Wilson of Mallens</i>.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>A little before the time at which my acquaintance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>with Mr. Wilson commenced, he had purchased a
beautiful estate on the lake of Windermere, which
bore the ancient name of <i>Elleray</i>&mdash;a name which,
with his customary good taste, Mr. Wilson has never
disturbed. With the usual latitude of language in
such cases, I say <i>on</i> Windermere; but in fact this
charming estate lies far above the lake; and one of
the most interesting of its domestic features is the
foreground of the rich landscape which connects, by
the most gentle scale of declivities, this almost a&euml;rial
altitude [as, for <i>habitable</i> ground, it really is] with the
sylvan margin of the deep water which rolls a mile
and a half below. When I say a mile and a half,
you will understand me to compute the descent according
to the undulations of the ground; because else
the perpendicular elevation above the level of the
lake cannot be above one half of that extent. Seated
on such an eminence, but yet surrounded by foregrounds
of such quiet beauty, and settling downwards
towards the lake by such tranquil steps as to
take away every feeling of precipitous or dangerous
elevation, Elleray possesses a double character of
beauty, rarely found in connection; and yet each,
by singular good fortune, in this case absolute and
unrivalled in its kind. Within a bow-shot of each
other may be found stations of the deepest seclusion,
fenced in by verdurous walls of insuperable forest
heights, and presenting a limited scene of beauty&mdash;deep,
solemn, noiseless, severely sequestered&mdash;and
other stations of a magnificence so gorgeous as few
estates in this island can boast, and of those few perhaps
none in such close connection with a dwelling-house.
Stepping out from the very windows of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>drawing-room, you find yourself on a terrace which
gives you the feeling of a 'specular height,' such as
you might expect on Ararat, or might appropriately
conceive on 'Athos seen from Samothrace.' The whole
course of a noble lake, about eleven miles long, lies
subject to your view, with many of its islands, and
its two opposite shores so different in character&mdash;the
one stern, precipitous, and gloomy; the other (and
luckily the hither one) by the mere bounty of nature
and of accident&mdash;by the happy disposition of the
ground originally, and by the fortunate equilibrium
between the sylvan tracts, meandering irregularly
through the whole district, and the proportion left to
verdant fields and meadows,&mdash;wearing the character
of the richest park scenery; except indeed that this
character is here and there a little modified by a quiet
hedge-row or the stealing smoke which betrays the
embowered cottage of a labourer. But the sublime,
peculiar, and not-to-be-forgotten feature of the scene is
the great system of mountains which unite about five
miles off at the head of the lake to lock in and inclose
this noble landscape. The several ranges of mountains
which stand at various distances within six or seven
miles of the little town of Ambleside, all separately
various in their forms and all eminently picturesque,
when seen from Elleray appear to blend and group
as parts of one connected whole; and when their
usual drapery of clouds happens to take a fortunate
arrangement, and the sunlights are properly broken
and thrown from the most suitable quarter of the
heavens,&mdash;I cannot recollect any spectacle in England
or Wales, of the many hundreds I have seen, bearing
a local, if not a national reputation for magnificence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>prospect, which so much dilates the heart with a sense
of power and a&euml;rial sublimity as this terrace view
from Elleray. It is possible that I may have stood
on other mountain terraces commanding as ample a
view and as happily combined; but the difference of
effect must always be immense between a spectacle
to which you ascend by half a day's labour, and that
upon which you are launched in a second of time
from the breakfast table. It is of great importance,
for the enjoyment of any natural scene, to be liberated
from the necessity of viewing it under circumstances
of haste and anxiety, to have it in one's power
to surrender oneself passively and tranquilly to the
influences of the objects as they gradually reveal
themselves, and to be under no summons to crowd
one's whole visual energy and task of examination
within a single quarter of an hour. Having seen
Elleray at all times under these favourable circumstances,
it is certainly not impossible that I may
unconsciously have overrated in some degree its pretensions
in comparison with some rival scenes. I
may have committed the common error of attributing
to the <i>objects</i> the whole sum of an impression which
in part belonged to the <i>subjective</i> advantages of the
contemplator and the benefits of his station. But,
making every allowance in this direction, I am still
of opinion that Elleray has, in connection with the
merits common to all scenes of its class, others
peculiar to itself&mdash;and such as are indispensable conditions
for the full effect of all the rest. In particular,
I would instance this: To bring any scene
upon a level of competition with Elleray as to range
and majesty of prospect, it is absolutely essential that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>it should occupy an equal elevation, or one not conspicuously
inferior. Now, it is seldom indeed that
eminences so commanding are not, by that very
circumstance, unfitted to the picturesque aspects of
things: in fact I remember no tract of ground so
elevated as Elleray from which the lowest level of
the adjacent country does not take a petty, dotted,
and map-like appearance. But this effect, which is
so heavy a price for the sublimities of the upper
regions, at Elleray is entirely intercepted by the
exquisite gradations of descent by which the contiguous
grounds begin their fall to the level of the
lake: the moment that this fall in any quarter
becomes accelerated and precipitous, it is concealed
by the brows of this beautiful hanging foreground;
and so happily is this remedy applied, that in every
instance where the lowest grounds would, if seen at
all, from their immediate proximity, be seen by the
spectator looking down perpendicularly as into a well,
there they are uniformly hidden; and these lowest
levels first emerge to view at a remote distance&mdash;where,
being necessarily viewed obliquely, they suffer
no peculiar disadvantage by being viewed from an
eminence. In short, to sum up the whole in one
word, the splendours of Elleray, which could not have
been had but at an unusual elevation, are by a rare
bounty of nature obtained without one of those sacrifices
for the learned eye which are usually entailed
upon that one single advantage of unusual elevation.</p>

<p>The beautiful estate, which I have thus described
to you, was ornamented by no suitable dwelling-house
at the time when it was purchased by Mr. Wilson:
there was indeed a rustic cottage, most picturesquely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>situated, which, with the addition of a drawing-room
thrown out at one end, was made for the present
(and, as it turned out, for many a year to come)
capable of meeting the hospitable system of life
adopted by its owner. But, with a view to more
ample and luxurious accommodations, even at that
early period of his possession (1808), Mr. Wilson
began to build a mansion of larger and more elegant
proportions. The shell, and perhaps the greater part
of the internal work, was soon finished; but for some
reason, which I never remember to have inquired
into, was not rendered thoroughly habitable (and
consequently not inhabited) till the year 1825. I
think it worth while to mention this house particularly,
because it has always appeared to me a silent
commentary on its master's state of mind, and an
exemplification of his character both as it was and
as it appeared. At first sight there was an air of
adventurousness, or even of extravagance about the
plan and situation of the building; and yet upon a
considerate examination (and latterly upon a practical
trial) of it, I cannot see that within the same dimensions
it would have been possible to have contrived
a more judicious or commodious house. Thus, for
instance, the house is planted upon the boldest and
most exposed point of ground that can be found on
the whole estate, consequently upon that which might
have presumed (and I believe was really reputed) to
be the very stormiest: yet, whether from counteracting
screens of wood that have since been reared in
fortunate situations, or from what other cause I know
not, but undoubtedly at this day no practical inconvenience
is suffered; though it is true, I believe, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>in the earlier years of its history, the house bore
witness occasionally, by dismal wrecks of roof and
windows, to the strength and fury of the wind on
one particular quarter. Again, in the internal arrangements
one room was constructed of such ample proportions,
with a view to dancing, that the length
(as I remember) was about seventy feet; the other
dimensions I have forgotten. Now, in this instance
most people saw an evidence of nothing but youthful
extravagance, and a most disproportionate attention
directed to one single purpose, which upon that scale
could not probably be of very frequent occurrence in
<i>any</i> family. This by the way was at any rate a
sensible extravagance in my judgment; for our
English mode of building tends violently to the opposite
and most unwholesome extravagance of giving
to the very principal room of a house the beggarly
proportions of closets. However, the sequel showed
that in providing for one end, Mr. Wilson had not
lost sight of others: for the seventy-feet room was so
divided by strong folding-doors, or temporary partitions,
as in its customary state to exhibit three
rooms of ordinary proportions, and unfolded its full
extent only by special and extraordinary mechanism.
Other instances I might give in which the plan seemed
to be extravagant or inconsiderate, and yet really
turned out to have been calculated with the coolest
judgment and the nicest foresight of domestic needs.
It is sufficient to say that I do not know a house
apparently more commodiously arranged than this,
which was planned and built with utmost precipitation,
and in the very heyday of a most tempestuous
youth. In one thing only, upon a retrospect at this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>day of the whole case, there may appear to have been
some imprudence, viz. that timber being then at a
most unprecedented high price, it is probable that
the building cost seven or eight hundred pounds more
than it would have done a few years later. Allowing
for this one oversight, the principal house on the
Elleray estate, which at the time was looked upon as
an evidence of Mr. Wilson's flightiness of mind,
remains at this day a lasting monument of his good
sense and judgment.</p>

<p>Whilst I justify him, however, on this head, I am
obliged to admit that on another field, at that very
time, Mr. Wilson was displaying the most reckless
profusion. A sailing club had been established on
Windermere, by whom I never heard; very probably
by Mr. Wilson himself; at all events, he was the
leader and the soul of the confederation; and he
applied annually nothing less than a little fortune to
the maintenance of the many expenses which arose
out of it. Amongst the members of the club there
were more than one who had far larger fortunes than
Mr. Wilson could ever have possessed; but he would
permit no one to outshine him on this arena. The
number of his boats was so great as to compose a
little fleet; and some of them, of unusually large
dimensions for this lake, had been built at an enormous
expense by regular builders brought over expressly
from the port of Whitehaven (distant from Elleray
about forty-five miles), and kept during the whole
progress of their labour at a most expensive Lakers'
hotel. One of these boats in particular, a ten-oared
barge, which you will find specially introduced by
name in Professor Wilson's tale of <i>The Foresters</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
(<i>vide</i> p. 215), was generally believed at the time to
have cost him at the least five hundred pounds. And
as the number of sailors which it required to man
these boats was necessarily very great at particular
seasons, and as the majority of these sailors lived,
during the period of their services, with little or no
restraint upon their expenses at the most costly inn
in the neighbourhood,&mdash;it may be supposed very
readily that about this time Mr. Wilson's lavish
expenditure, added to the demands of architects and
builders, and the recent purchase of Elleray, must
have seriously injured his patrimonial property,&mdash;though
generally believed to have been originally considerably
more than thirty thousand (many asserted
forty thousand) pounds. In fact, he had never less
than three establishments going on concurrently for
some years; one at the town or village of Bowness
(the little port of the lake of Windermere), for his
boatmen; one at the Ambleside Hotel, about five
miles distant, for himself; and a third at Elleray, for
his servants, and the occasional resort of himself and
his friends. It is the opinion of some people that
about this time, and during the succeeding two years,
Mr. Wilson dissipated the main bulk of his patrimony
in profuse expenditure. But more considerate people
see no ground for that opinion: his expenses, though
great, were never adequate to the dilapidation of so
large an estate as he was reputed to have inherited:
and the prevailing opinion is that some great loss of
&pound;20,000 at a blow, by the failure of some trustee or
other, was the true cause of that diminution in his
property which, within a year or two from this time,
he is generally supposed to have suffered. However,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>as Mr. Wilson himself has always maintained an
obstinate silence on the subject, and as the mere fact
of the loss (however probable) is not more accurately
known to me than its extent, or its particular mode,
or its cause,&mdash;I shall not allow myself to make any
conjectural speculations on the subject. It can be
interesting to you and me only from one of its consequences,
viz. its leading him afterwards to seek a
professorship: for most certain it is, that, if the
splendour of Mr. Wilson's youthful condition as to
pecuniary matters had not been in some remarkable
degree overcast, and suffered some signal eclipse, he
would never have surrendered any part of that perfect
liberty which was so dear to him, for all the honours
and rewards that could have been offered by the
foremost universities of Europe.</p>

<p>You will have heard, no doubt, from some of those
with whom you conversed about Professor Wilson
when you were in Europe, or you may have read it
in Peter's Letters, that in very early life (probably
about the age of eighteen) he had formed a scheme
for penetrating into central Africa, visiting the city
of Tombuctoo, and solving (if it were possible) the
great outstanding problem of the course of the Niger.
To this scheme he was attracted probably not so much
by any particular interest in the improvement of
geographical knowledge, as by the youthful spirit of
romantic adventure, and a very uncommon craving
for whatever was grand&mdash;indefinite&mdash;and gigantic in
conception, supposing that it required at the same
time great physical powers in the execution. There
cannot be a doubt for us at this day, who look back
upon the melancholy list of victims in this perilous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>field of discovery which has been furnished by the
two or three and twenty years elapsed since Mr.
Wilson's plan was in agitation, that in that enterprise&mdash;had
he ever irretrievably embarked himself upon
it&mdash;he would infallibly have perished; for, though
reasonably strong, he was not strong upon that
heroic scale which an expedition so Titanic demands;
and what was perhaps still more important, if strong
enough&mdash;he was not <i>hardy</i> enough, as a gentleman
rarely is, more especially where he has literary habits;
because the exposure to open air, which is the indispensable
condition of hardiness, is at any rate interrupted&mdash;even
if it were not counteracted&mdash;by the
luxurious habits and the relaxing atmosphere of the
library and the drawing-room. Moreover, Mr. Wilson's
constitution was irritable and disposed to fever; his
temperament was too much that of a man of genius
not to have furnished a mine of inflammable materials
for any tropical climate; his prudence, as regarded
his health, was not remarkable; and if to all these
internal and personal grounds of danger you add the
incalculable hazards of the road itself, every friend of
Mr. Wilson's must have rejoiced on hearing that in
1808, when I first met him, this Tim-(or Tom-) buctoo
scheme was already laid aside.</p>

<p>Yet, as the stimulus of danger, in one shape or
other, was at that time of life perhaps essential to his
comfort, he soon substituted another scheme, which
at this day might be accomplished with ease and
safety enough, but in the year 1809 (under the
rancorous system of Bonaparte) was full of hazard.
In this scheme he was so good as to associate myself
as one of his travelling companions, together with an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>earlier friend of his own&mdash;an Englishman, of a philosophical
turn of mind, with whom he had been a fellow-student
at Glasgow; and we were certainly all three
of an age and character to have enjoyed the expedition
in the very highest degree, had the events of the war
allowed us to realise our plan. The plan was as
follows: from Falmouth, by one of the regular
packets, we were to have sailed to the Tagus; and,
landing wherever accident should allow us, to purchase
mules&mdash;hire Spanish servants&mdash;and travel extensively
in Spain and Portugal for eight or nine
months; thence, by such of the islands in the Mediterranean
as particularly interested us, we were
gradually to have passed into Greece, and thence to
Constantinople. Finally, we were to have visited
the Troad, Syria, Egypt, and perhaps Nubia. I feel
it almost ludicrous to sketch the outline of so extensive
a tour, no part of which was ever executed; such
a Barmacide feast is laughable in the very rehearsal.
Yet it is bare justice to ourselves to say that on our
parts there was no slackness or <i>make-believe</i>: what
put an extinguisher upon our project was the entrance
of Napoleon into Spain, his immediate advance upon
Madrid, and the wretched catastrophe of the expedition
so miserably misconducted under Sir John
Moore. The <i>prestige</i> of French generalship was at
that time a nightmare upon the courage and spirit of
hopeful exertion throughout Europe; and the earliest
dawn was only then beginning to arise of that glorious
experience which was for ever to dissolve it. Sir J.
Moore, and through him his gallant but unfortunate
army, was the last conspicuous victim to the mere
sound and <i>humbug</i> (if you will excuse a coarse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>expression) of the words <i>Napoleon Bonaparte</i>. What
he fled from was precisely those two words. And the
timid policy, adopted by Sir John on that memorable
occasion, would&mdash;among other greater and national
consequences&mdash;have had this little collateral interest
to us unfortunate travellers, had our movements been
as speedy as we had anticipated, that it would have
cost us our heads. A certain bulletin, issued by
Bonaparte at that time, sufficiently apprised us of
that little truth. In this bulletin Bonaparte proclaimed
with a careless air, but making at the same
time somewhat of a boast of it, that having happened
to meet a party of sixteen British travellers&mdash;persons
of whom he had ascertained nothing at all but that
they did not bear a military character&mdash;he had issued
a summary order that they should all be strung up
without loss of time by the neck. In this little
facetious anecdote, as Bonaparte seemed to think it,
we read the fate that we had escaped. Had nothing
occurred to retard our departure from this country,
we calculated that the route we had laid down for
our daily motions would have brought us to Guadarama
(or what was the name of the pass?) just in
time to be hanged. Having a British general at our
backs with an army of more than thirty thousand
effective men, we should certainly have roamed in
advance with perfect reliance upon the old British
policy of fighting, for which we could never have
allowed ourselves to dream of such a substitute as
a flight through all the passes of Gallicia on the
principle of '<i>the D&mdash;&mdash; take the hindmost</i>.' Infallibly
also we should have been surprised by the extraordinary
rapidity at that time of the French movements;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>our miserable shambling mules, with their
accursed tempers, would have made but a shabby
attempt at flight before a squadron of light cavalry;
and in short, as I said before, we should have come
just in time to be hanged. And hanged we should
all have been: though <i>why</i>, and upon what principle,
it would be difficult to say; and probably that question
would have been left to after consideration in some
more philosophical age. You will suppose naturally
that we rejoiced at our escape; and so undoubtedly
we did. Yet for my part I had, among nineteen-twentieths
of joy, just one-twentieth of a lingering
regret that we had missed the picturesque fate that
awaited us. The reason was this: it has been through
life an infirmity of Mr. Wilson's (at least in my
judgment an infirmity) to think too indulgently of
Bonaparte, not merely in an intellectual point of view,
but even with reference to his pretensions&mdash;hollower,
one would think, than the wind&mdash;to moral elevation
and magnanimity. Such a mistake, about a man who
could never in any one instance bring himself to
speak generously, or even forbearingly of an enemy,
rouses my indignation as often as I recur to it; and
in Professor Wilson, I have long satisfied myself that
it takes its rise from a more comprehensive weakness,
the greatest in fact which besets his mind, viz. a
general tendency to bend to the prevailing opinion
of the world, and a constitutional predisposition, to
sympathise with power and whatsoever is triumphant.
Hence, I could not but regret most poignantly the
capital opportunity I had forfeited of throwing in a
deep and stinging sarcasm at his idol, just at the
moment when we should have been waiting to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>turned off. I know Professor Wilson well: though
a brave man, at twenty-two he enjoyed life with a
rapture that few men have ever known, and he would
have clung to it with awful tenacity. Horribly he
would have abominated the sight of the rope, and
ruefully he would have sighed if I had suggested to
him on the gallows any thoughts of that beautiful
and quiet Elleray which he had left behind in England.
Just at that moment I acknowledge that it would
have been fiendish, but yet what a heaven of a luxury
it would have been in the way of revenge&mdash;to have
stung him with some neat epigram, that I might
have composed in our walk to the gallows, or while
the ropes were getting into tune, on the generosity
and magnanimity of Bonaparte! Perhaps, in a sober
estimate, hanging might be too heavy a price for the
refutation of a single error; yet still, at times, when
my moral sense is roused and provoked by the
obstinate blindness of Professor Wilson to the meanness
and <i>parvanimity</i><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> of Bonaparte (a blindness
which in him, as in all other worshippers of false
idols, is connected at the moment with intense hatred
for those who refuse to partake in it), a wandering
regret comes over me that we should have missed so
fine an opportunity for gathering in our own persons
some of those redundant bounties which the Corsican's
'magnanimity' at that time scattered from his cornucopia
of malice to the English name upon all his
unfortunate prisoners of that nation.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>But enough of this; an event soon occurred in Mr.
Wilson's life which made it a duty to dismiss for
ever all travelling schemes that were connected with
so much hazard as this. The fierce <i>acharnement</i> of
Bonaparte so pointedly directed to everything English,
and the prostration of the Continent, which had
enabled him absolutely to seal every port of Europe
against an Englishman, who could now no longer
venture to stray a mile beyond the range of the ship's
guns, which had brought him to the shore, without
the certainty of being arrested as a spy,&mdash;this unheard-of
condition of things had at length compelled all
English gentlemen to reconcile themselves for the
present to the bounds of their own island; and,
accordingly, in the spring of 1809, we three unhanged
friends had entirely weaned our minds from the
travelling scheme which had so completely occupied
our thoughts in 1808. Mr. Wilson in particular gave
himself up to the pleasures and occupations furnished
by the neighbourhood of Windermere, which at that
time were many and various; living myself at a
distance of nine miles from Elleray, I did not see
much of him through this year 1809; in 1810 he
married a young English lady, greatly admired for
her beauty and the elegance of her manners, who was
generally supposed to have brought him a fortune of
about ten thousand pounds. In saying <i>that</i>, I violate
no confidence at any time reposed in me, for I rely
only on the public voice&mdash;which, in this instance, I
have been told by well-informed persons, was tolerably
correct. Be that as it may, however, in other respects
I have the best reasons for believing that this marriage
connection has proved the happiest event of Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Wilson's life; and that the delightful temper and
disposition of his wife have continued to shed a
sunshine of peace and quiet happiness over his
domestic establishment, which were well worth all
the fortunes in the world. This lady has brought
him a family of two sons and three daughters, all
interesting by their personal appearance and their
manners, and at this time rapidly growing up into
young men and women.</p>

<p>Here I should close all further notice of Mr. Wilson's
life, and confine myself, through what remains of the
space which I have allowed myself, to a short critical
notice (such as it may be proper for a friend to write)
of his literary character and merits; but one single
event remains of a magnitude too conspicuous in any
man's life to be dismissed wholly without mention.
I should add, therefore, that, about eight or nine
years after his marriage (for I forget the precise
year<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>), Mr. Wilson offered himself a candidate for
the chair of Moral Philosophy in the University in
Edinburgh, which had recently become vacant by the
death of Dr. Thomas Brown, the immediate successor
of Mr. Dugald Stewart. The Scotch, who know just
as much about what they call 'Moral<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Philosophy'
and Metaphysics as the English do, viz. exactly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>nothing at all, pride themselves prodigiously upon
these two names of Dugald Stewart and Dr. Brown,
and imagine that they filled the chair with some
peculiar brilliance. Upon that subject a word or two
farther on. Meantime this notion made the contest
peculiarly painful and invidious, amongst ungenerous
enemies, for any untried man&mdash;no matter though his
real merits had been a thousand times greater than
those of his predecessors. This Mr. Wilson found;
he had made himself enemies; whether by any
unjustifiable violences, and wanton provocations on
his own part, I have no means of knowing. In
whatever way created, however, these enemies now
used the advantages of the occasion with rancorous
malignity, and persecuted him at every step with
unrelenting fury. Very different was the treatment
he met with from his competitor in the contest; in
that one circumstance of the case, the person of his
competitor, he had reason to think himself equally
fortunate and unfortunate; fortunate, that he should
be met by the opposition of a man whose opposition
was honour&mdash;a man of birth, talents, and high
breeding, a good scholar, and for extensive reading
and universal knowledge of books (and especially of
philosophic literature) the Magliabecchi of Scotland;
unfortunate on the other hand that this accomplished
opponent, adorned by so many brilliant gifts that
recommended him to the contested office, should
happen to be his early and highly valued friend.
The particular progress of the contest, and its circumstances,
I am not able to state; in general I have
heard in Edinburgh that, from political influences
which chiefly governed the course of the election, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>conduct of the partisans (perhaps on both sides) was
intemperate, personal, and unjust; whilst that of the
principals and their immediate friends was full of
forbearance and generosity. The issue was, that Mr.
Wilson carried the Professorship,&mdash;by what majority
of votes, I am unable to say; and you will be pleased
to hear that any little coolness, which must naturally
have succeeded to so warm a contest, has long since
passed away; and the two rival candidates have been
for many years restored to their early feelings of
mutual esteem and regard.</p>

<p>Here I pause for everything that concerns in the
remotest way the incidents of Professor Wilson's life;
one letter I mean to add, as I have already promised,
on the particular position which he occupies in relation
to modern literature; and then I have done.
Meantime, let me hope that you have not so far
miscalculated my purpose as to have been looking
out for anecdotes (<i>i. e.</i> scandal) about Professor
Wilson throughout the course of this letter; since,
if in any case I could descend to cater for tastes of
that description (which I am persuaded, are naturally
no tastes of <i>your</i> family),&mdash;you must feel, on reflection,
how peculiarly impossible it is to take that
course in sketching the character of a friend, because
the very means, by which in almost every case one
becomes possessed of such private anecdotes, are the
opportunities thrown in one's way by the confiding
negligence of affectionate friendship; opportunities
therefore which must be for ever sacred to every man
of honour.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of 'Titan.'</i></p>


<p>My Dear Sir,&mdash;I send you a few hasty notes upon
Mr. Robert Ferguson's little work (relating to the
dialect current at the English Lakes).<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Mr. Ferguson's
book is learned and seasonable, adapted to the stage
at which such studies have now arrived among us,
and adapted also to a popular use. I am sure that
Mr. Ferguson knows a great deal more about his very
interesting theme than <i>I</i> do. Nevertheless, I presume
to sit in judgment upon him; or so it will be inferred
from my assuming the office of his reviewer. But in
reality I pretend to no such ambitious and invidious
functions. What I propose to do, in this hasty and
<i>extempore</i> fashion, is&mdash;simply to take a seat in Mr.
Ferguson's court as an <i>amicus curi&aelig;</i>, and occasionally
to suggest a doubt, by possibility an amendment; but
more often to lead astray judge, jury, and docile
audience into matter growing out of the subject, but
very seldom leading back into it, too often, perhaps,
having little to do with it; pleasant by possibility,
according to Foote's judgment in a parallel case,
'pleasant, but wrong.' No great matter if it should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>be so. It will be read within the privileged term of
Christmas;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> during which licensed saturnalia it can
be no blame to any paper, that it is 'pleasant, but
wrong.'</p>

<p>I begin with lodging a complaint against Mr.
Ferguson, namely, that he has ignored me&mdash;me, that
in some measure may be described as having broken
ground originally in this interesting field of research.
Me, the undoubted parent of such studies&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> the
person who first solemnly proclaimed the Danish
language to be the master-key for unlocking the
peculiarities of the Lake dialect&mdash;me, has this undutiful
son never noticed, except incidentally, and then
only with some reserve, or even with a distinct scruple,
as regards the particular point of information for
which I am cited. Seriously, however, this very
passage, which offers me the affront of utter exclusion
from what I had regarded as my own peculiar territory,
my own Danish ring-fence, shows clearly that
no affront had been designed. Mr. Ferguson had
found occasion, at p. 80, to mention that <i>Fairfield</i>,
the most distinguished<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> of the Grasmere boundaries,
and 'next neighbour to Helvellyn' (next also in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>magnitude, being above three thousand feet high),
had, as regarded its name, 'been derived from the
Scandinavian <i>faar</i>, sheep, in allusion to the peculiar
fertility of its pastures.' He goes on thus&mdash;'This
mountain' (says De Quincey) 'has large, smooth
pastoral savannahs, to which the sheep resort when
all its rocky or barren neighbours are left desolate.'
In thus referring to myself for the character of the
mountain, he does not at all suppose that he is
referring to the author of the etymology. On the
contrary, the very next sentence says&mdash;'I do not
know who is the author of this etymology, which has
been quoted by several writers; but it appears to me
to be open to considerable doubt'; and this for two
separate reasons, which he assigns, and which I will
notice a little further on.</p>

<p>Meantime I pause, for the sake of saying that the
derivation is mine. Thirty-seven, or it may be thirty-eight,
years ago, I first brought forward my Danish
views in a local newspaper&mdash;namely, <i>The Kendal
Gazette</i>, published every Saturday. The rival (I may
truly say&mdash;the hostile) newspaper, published also on
Saturday, was called <i>The Westmoreland Chronicle</i>.
The exact date of my own communication upon the
dialect of the Lake district I cannot at this moment
assign. Earlier than 1818 it could not have been,
nor later than 1820. What first threw me upon this
vein of exploring industry was, the accidental stumbling
suddenly upon an interesting little incident of
Westmoreland rustic life. From a roadside cottage,
just as I came nearly abreast of its door, issued a
little child; not old enough to walk with particular
firmness, but old enough for mischief; a laughing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>expression of which it bore upon its features. It was
clearly in the act of absconding from home, and was
hurrying earnestly to a turn of the road which it
counted upon making available for concealment. But,
before it could reach this point, a young woman, of
remarkable beauty, perhaps twenty years old, ran out
in some alarm, which was not diminished by hearing
the sound of carriage-wheels rapidly coming up from
a distance of probably two furlongs. The little rosy
thing stopped and turned on hearing its mother's
voice, but hesitated a little, until she made a gesture
of withdrawing her handkerchief from her bosom, and
said, coaxingly, 'Come its ways, then, and get its
<i>patten</i>.' Until that reconciling word was uttered,
there had been a shadow of distrust on the baby's
face, as if treachery might be in the wind. But the
magic of that one word <i>patten</i> wrought an instant
revolution. Back the little truant ran, and the young
mother's manner made it evident that she would not
on <i>her</i> part forget what had passed between the high
contracting parties.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> What, then, could be the meaning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>of this talismanic word <i>patten</i>? Accidentally,
having had a naval brother confined amongst the
Danes, as a prisoner of war, for eighteen months, I
knew that it meant the female bosom. Soon after I
stumbled upon the meaning of the Danish word
<i>Skyandren</i>&mdash;namely, what in street phrase amongst
ourselves is called giving to any person a <i>blowing-up</i>.
This was too remarkable a word, too bristling with
harsh blustering consonants, to baffle the detecting
ear, as it might have done under any masquerading
<i>aura-textilis</i>, or woven air of vowels and diphthongs.</p>

<p>Many scores of times I had heard men threatening
to <i>skiander</i> this person or that when next they should
meet. Not by possibility could it indicate any mode
of personal violence; for no race of men could be
more mild and honourably forbearing in their intercourse
with each other than the manly dalesmen of
the Lakes. From the context, it had long been
evident that it implied expostulation and <i>verbal</i>
reproach. And now at length I learned that this was
its Danish import. The very mountain at the foot of
which my Grasmere cottage stood, and the little
orchard attached to which formed 'the lowest step in
that magnificent staircase' (such was Wordsworth's
description of it), leading upwards to the summits of
Helvellyn, reminded me daily of that Danish language
which all around me suggested as being the secret
writing&mdash;the seal&mdash;the lock that imprisoned ancient
records as to thing or person, and yet again as being
the key that should open this lock; as that which
had hidden through many centuries, and yet also as
that which should finally reveal.</p>

<p>I have thus come round to the name of Fairfield,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>which seemed to me some forty years ago as beyond
all reasonable doubt the Danish mask for <i>Sheep-fell</i>.
But, in using the phrase '<i>reasonable</i> doubt,' I am far
from insinuating that Mr. Ferguson's deliberate doubt
is <i>not</i> reasonable. I will state both sides of the
question, for neither is without some show of argument.
To me it seemed next to impossible that the
early Danish settlers could, under the natural pressure
of prominent differences among that circuit of hills
which formed the barriers of Grasmere, have failed to
distinguish as the sheep mountain that sole eminence
which offered a pasture ground to their sheep all the
year round. In summer and autumn <i>all</i> the neighbouring
fells, that were not mere rocks, yielded pasture
more or less scanty. But Fairfield showed herself the
<i>alma mater</i> of their flocks even in winter and early
spring. So, at least, my local informants asserted.
Mr. Ferguson, however, objects, as an unaccountable
singularity, that on this hypothesis we shall have one
mountain, and one only, classed under the <i>modern</i>
Scandinavian term of <i>field</i>; all others being known
by the elder name of <i>fell</i>. I acknowledge that this
anomaly is perplexing. But, on the other hand, what
Mr. Ferguson suggests is still more perplexing. He
supposes that, 'because' the summit of this mountain
is such a peculiarly green and level plain, it might
not inappropriately be called <i>a fair field</i>.' Certainly
it might; but by Englishmen of recent generations,
and not by Danish immigrants of the ninth century.
To balance the anomaly of what certainly wears a
faint <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of anachronism&mdash;namely, the <i>apparent</i>
anticipation of the modern Norse word <i>field</i>, Mr.
Ferguson's conjecture would take a headlong plunge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>into good classical English. Now of this there is no
other instance. Even the little swells of ground, that
hardly rise to the dignity of hills, which might be
expected to submit readily to changing appellations,
under the changing accidents of ownership, yet still
retain their primitive Scandinavian names&mdash;as <i>Butterlip
Howe</i>, for example. Nor do I recollect any exceptions
to this tendency, unless in the case of jocose
names, such as <i>Skiddaw's Cub</i>, for Lattrig; and into
this class, perhaps, falls even the dignified mountain
of <i>The Old Man</i>, at the head of Coniston. Mr.
Ferguson will allow that it would be as startling to
the dense old Danes of King Alfred's time, if they
had found a mountain of extra pretensions wearing a
modern English name, as it would to the Macedonian
<i>argyraspides</i>, if suspecting that, in some coming century,
their mighty leader, 'the great Emathian conqueror,'
could by any possible Dean of St. Patrick,
and by any conceivable audacity of legerdemain, be
traced back to <i>All-eggs-under-the-grate</i>. If the name
really <i>is</i> good English, in that case a separate and
<i>extra</i> labour arises for us all; there must have been
some old Danish name for this most serviceable of
fells; and then we have not merely to explain the
present English name, but also to account for the
disappearance of this arch&aelig;ological Danish name.
What I would throw out conjecturally as a bare
possibility is this:&mdash;When an ancient dialect (A) is
gradually superseded by a more modern one (E), the
flood of innovation which steals over the old reign, and
gradually dispossesses it, does not rush in simultaneously
as a torrent, but supervenes stealthily and
unequally, according to the humouring or thwarting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>of local circumstances. Nobody, I am sure, is better
aware of this accident, as besetting the transit of
dialects, than Mr. Ferguson. For instance, many of
those words which are imported to us from the
American United States, and often amuse us by their
picturesqueness, have originally been carried to
America by our own people; in England they lurked
for ages as provincialisms, localised within some
narrow circuit, and to which some trifling barrier (as
a river&mdash;rivulet&mdash;or even a brook) offered a retarding
force. In supercivilised England, a river, it may be
thought, cannot offer much obstruction to the free
current of words; ages ago it must have been bridged
over. Sometimes, however, a bridge is impossible
under the transcendent importance of a free navigation.
For instance, at the Bristol Hotwells, the
ready and fluent intercourse with Long Ashton, and
a long line of adjacencies, is effectually obstructed by
the necessity of an open water communication with
the Bristol Channel. At one period (<i>i. e.</i> when as yet
Liverpool and Glasgow were fifth-rate ports), all the
wealth of the West Indies flowed into England
through this little muddy ditch of the Bristol Avon,
and Rownham Ferry became the exponent and
measure of English intercourse with the northern
nook of Somersetshire. A river is bad; but when
a mountain of very toilsome ascent happens to be
interposed, the interruption offered to the popular
intercourse, and the results of this interruption,
become much more memorable. An illustration which
I can offer on this point, and which, in fact, I <i>did</i>
offer (as, upon inquiry, Mr. Ferguson will find), thirty-eight
years ago, happens to bear with peculiar force
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>upon our immediate difficulty of Fairfield. The valleys
on the northern side of Kirkstone&mdash;namely, in particular,
the three valleys of Patterdale, Matterdale,
and Martindale&mdash;are as effectually cut off from
intercourse with the valleys on the southern side&mdash;namely,
the Windermere valley, Ryedale, and Grasmere,
with all their tributary nooks and attachments&mdash;as
though an arm of the sea had rolled between them.
It costs a foot traveller half of a summer's day to
effect the passage to and fro over Kirkstone (what
the Greeks so tersely expressed in the case of a race-course<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
by the one word <i>diaulos</i>). And in <i>my</i> time
no innkeeper from the Windermere side of Kirkstone
would carry even a solitary individual across with
fewer than four horses. What has been the result?
Why, that the dialect on the northern side of Kirkstone
bears the impress of a more ultra-Danish
influence than that upon the Windermere side. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>particular this remarkable difference occurs: not the
nouns and verbs merely are Danish amongst the
trans-Kirkstonians (I speak as a Grasmerian), but
even the particles&mdash;the very joints and articulations
of language. The Danish <i>at</i>, for instance, is used for
<i>to</i>; I do not mean for <i>to</i> the preposition: they do not
say, 'Carry this letter at Mr. 'W.'; but as the sign
of the infinitive mood. 'Tell him <i>at</i> put his spurs on,
and <i>at</i> ride off for a surgeon?' Now this illustration
carries along with it a proof that a stronger and a
weaker infusion of the Danish element, possibly an
older and a younger infusion, may prevail even
in close adjacencies, provided they are powerfully
divided by walls of rock that happen to be eight miles
thick.</p>

<p>But the inexorable Press, that waits for few men
under the rank of a king, and not always for <i>him</i> (as
I happen to know, by having once seen a proof-sheet
corrected by the royal hand of George IV., which
proof exhibited some disloyal signs of impatience),
forces me to adjourn all the rest to next month.&mdash;</p>

<p>What two works are those for which at this moment
our national intellect (or, more rigorously speaking,
our <i>popular</i> intellect) is beginning clamorously to call?
They are these: first, a <i>Conversations-Lexicon</i>, obeying
(as regards plan and purpose) the general outline of
the German work bearing that title; ministering to
the same elementary necessities; implying, therefore,
a somewhat corresponding stage of progress in our
own populace and that of Germany; but otherwise
(as regards the executive details in adapting such a
work to the special service of an English public)
moving under moral restraints sterner by much, and
more faithfully upheld, than could rationally be looked
for in any great literary enterprise resigned to purely
German impulses. For over the atmosphere of
thought and feeling in Germany there broods no
<i>public</i> conscience. Such a <i>Conversations-Lexicon</i> is
one of the two great works for which the popular
mind of England is waiting and watching in silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
The other (and not less important) work is&mdash;a faithful
<i>History of England</i>. We will offer, at some future
time, a few words upon the first; but upon the
second&mdash;here brought before us so advantageously
in the earnest, thoughtful, and oftentimes eloquent
volumes of Mr. Froude&mdash;we will venture to offer
three or four pages of critical comment.</p>

<p>Could the England of the sixteenth century have
escaped that great convulsion which accompanied the
dissolution of the monasteries? It is barely possible
that a gentle system of periodic decimations, distributing
this inevitable ruin over an entire century,
might have blunted the edge of the fierce ploughshare:
but there were difficulties in the way of such
arrangements, that would too probably have thwarted
the benign purpose.</p>

<p>Meantime, what was it that had stolen like a
canker-worm into the machinery of these monastic
bodies, and insensibly had corroded a principle originally
of admitted purity? The malice of Protestantism
has too readily assumed that Popery was answerable
for this corrosion. But it would be hard to show
that Popery in any one of its features, good or bad,
manifested itself conspicuously and operatively: nay,
to say the simple truth, it was through the very
opposite agency that the monastic institutions came
to ruin: it was because Popery, that supreme control
to which these monasteries had been confided, shrank
from its responsibilities&mdash;weakly, lazily, or even perfidiously,
abandoned that supervisorship in default of
which neither right of inspection, nor duty of inspection,
nor power of inspection, was found to be lodged
in any quarter&mdash;<i>there</i> it was, precisely in that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>dereliction of censorial authority, that all went to
ruin. All corporations grow corrupt, unless habitually
kept under the eye of public inspection, or else
officially liable to searching visitations. Now, who
were the regular and official visitors of the English
monasteries? Not the local bishops; for in that case
the public clamour, the very notoriety of the scandals
(as we see them reported by Wicliffe and Chaucer),
would have guided the general wrath to some effectual
surgery for the wounds and ulcers of the institutions.
Unhappily the official visitors were the heads of the
monastic orders; these, and these only. A Franciscan
body, for example, owed no obedience except to the
representative of St. Francis; and this representative
too uniformly resided somewhere on the Continent.
And thus it was that effectually and virtually English
monasteries were subject to no control. Nay, the
very corrections of old abuses by English parliamentary
statutes had greatly strengthened the evil.
Formerly, the monastic funds were drawn upon to
excess in defraying the costs of a transmarine visitation.
But that evil, rising into enormous proportions,
was at length radically extirpated by parliamentary
statutes that cut down the costs; so that continental
devotees, finding their visitations no longer profitable
in a pecuniary sense, sometimes even costly to themselves,
and costly upon a scale but dimly intelligible
to any continental experience, rapidly cooled down in
their pious enthusiasm against monastic delinquencies.
Hatred, at any rate, and malignant anger the visitor
had to face, not impossibly some risk of assassination,
in prosecuting his inquiries into the secret crimes of
monks that were often confederated in a common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>interest of resistance to all honest or searching inquiry.
But, if to these evils were superadded others
of a pecuniary class, it was easy to anticipate, under
this failure of all regular inspectorship, a period of
plenary indulgence to the excesses of these potent
corporations. Such a period came: no man being
charged with the duty of inspection, no man inspected;
but never was the danger more surely at hand, than
when it seemed by all ordinary signs to have absolutely
died out. Already, in the days of Richard II.,
the doom of the monasteries might be heard muttering
in the chambers of the upper air. In the angry
denunciations of Wicliffe, in the popular merriment
of Chaucer, might be read the same sentence of condemnation
awarded against them. Fierce warnings
were given to them at intervals. A petition against
them was addressed by the House of Commons to
Henry IV. The son of this prince, the man of
Agincourt, though superstitious enough, if superstition
could have availed them, had in <i>his</i> short reign
(so occupied, one might have thought, with war and
foreign affairs) found time to read them a dreadful
warning: more than five scores of these offending
bodies (Priories Alien) were suppressed by that single
monarch, the laughing <i>Hal</i> of Jack Falstaff. One
whole century slipped away between this penal suppression
and the ministry of Wolsey. What effect
can we ascribe to this admonitory chastisement upon
the general temper and conduct of the monastic
interest? It would be difficult beyond measure at
this day to draw up any adequate report of the foul
abuses prevailing in the majority of religious houses,
for the three following reasons:&mdash;First, because the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>main record of such abuses, after it had been elaborately
compiled under the commission of Henry VIII.,
was (at the instigation of his eldest daughter Mary)
most industriously destroyed by Bishop Bonner;
secondly, because too generally the original oath of
religious fidelity and secrecy, in matters interesting
to the founder and the foundation, was held to interfere
with frank disclosures; thirdly, because, as to
much of the most crying licentiousness, its full and
satisfactory detection too often depended upon a
surprise. Steal upon the delinquents suddenly, and
ten to one they were caught <i>flagrante delicto</i>: but
upon any notice transpiring of the hostile approach,
all was arranged so as to evade for the moment&mdash;or
in the end to baffle finally&mdash;search alike and suspicion.</p>

<p>The following report, which Mr. Froude views as
the liveliest of all that Bishop Bonner's zeal has
spared, offers a picturesque sketch of such cases,
according to the shape which they often assumed. In
Chaucer's tale, told with such unrivalled <i>vis comica</i>,
of the <i>Trompington Miller and the Two Cambridge
Scholars</i>, we have a most life-like picture of the miller
with his 'big bones,' as a 'dangerous' man for the
nonce. Just such a man, just as dangerous, and just
as big-boned, we find in the person of an abbot&mdash;defending
his abbey, not by any reputation for sanctity
or learning, but solely by his <i>dangerousness</i> as the
wielder of quarter-staff and cudgel. With no bull-dog
or mastiff, and taken by surprise, such an abbot
naturally lost the stakes for which he played. The
letter is addressed to the Secretary of State:&mdash;'Please
it your goodness to understand, that on Friday the
22nd of October (1535), I rode back with speed to take
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>an inventory of Folkstone; and thence I went to
Langden. Whereat immediately descending from
my horse, I sent Bartlett, your servant, with all <i>my</i>
servants, to circumsept the abbey [<i>i. e.</i> to form a
hedge round about], and surely to keep [guard] all
back-doors and starting holes. I myself went alone
to the abbot's lodging&mdash;joining upon the fields and
wood.' [This position, the reporter goes on to insinuate,
was no matter of chance: but, like a rabbit-warren,
had been so placed with a view to the
advantages for retreat and for cover in the adjacent
woodlands.] 'I was a good space knocking at the
abbot's door; neither did any sound or sensible
manifestation of life betray itself, saving the abbot's
little dog, that within his door, fast locked, bayed and
barked. I found a short pole-axe standing behind
the door; and with it I dashed the abbot's door in
pieces <i>ictu oculi</i> [in the twinkling of an eye]; and set
one of my men to keep that door; and about the
house I go with that pole-axe in my hand&mdash;<i>ne forte</i>
["<i>lest by any chance</i>"<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>&mdash;holding in suspense such
words as "<i>some violence should be offered</i>"]&mdash;for the
abbot is a dangerous, desperate knave, and a hardy.
But, for a conclusion, his gentlewoman bestirred her
stumps towards her starting holes; and then Bartlett,
watching the pursuit, took the tender <i>demoisel</i>; and,
after I had examined her, to Dover&mdash;to the mayor,
to set her in some cage or prison for eight days.
And I brought holy father abbot to Canterbury;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>and here, in Christ Church, I will leave him in
prison.'</p>

<p>This little interlude, offering its several figures in
such life-like attitudes&mdash;its big-boned abbot prowling
up and down the precincts of the abbey for the chance
of a 'shy' at the intruding commissioner&mdash;the little
faithful bow-wow doing its <i>petit possible</i> to warn big-bones
of his danger, thus ending his faithful services
by an act of farewell loyalty&mdash;and the unlucky
<i>demoisel</i> scuttling away to her rabbit-warren, only to
find all the spiracles and peeping-holes preoccupied or
stopped, and her own 'apparel' unhappily locked up
'<i>in the abbot his coffer</i>,' so as to render hopeless all
evasion or subsequent denial of the fact, that ten
big-boned 'indusia' (or shirts) lay interleaved in one
and the same 'coffer,' <i>inter totidem niveas camisas</i><a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> (or
chemises)&mdash;all this framed itself as a little amusing
parenthesis, a sort of family picture amongst the
dreadful reports of ecclesiastical commissioners.</p>

<p>No <i>suppression</i> of the religious houses had originally
been designed; nothing more than a searching <i>visitation</i>.
And at this moment, yes, at this present
midsummer of 1856, waiting and looking forward to
the self-same joyful renewal of leases that then was
looked for in England, but not improbably, alas!
summoned to the same ineffable disappointment as
fell more than three centuries back upon our own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
England&mdash;lies, waiting for her doom, a great kingdom
in central Europe. She, and under the same causes,
may chance to be disappointed. What was it that
caused the tragic convulsion in England? Simply
this: regular and healthy visitation having ceased,
infinite abuses had arisen; and these abuses, it was
found at last, could not be healed by any measure less
searching than absolute suppression. Austria, as
regards some of her provinces, stands in the same
circumstances at this very moment. Imperfect
visitations, that cleansed nothing, should naturally
have left her religious establishments languishing for
the one sole remedy that was found applicable to the
England of 1540. And what was <i>that</i>? It was a
remedy that carried along with it revolution. England
was found able in those days to stand that fierce
medicine: a more profound revolution has not often
been witnessed than that of our mighty Reformation.
Can Austria, considering the awful contagions
amongst which her political relations have entangled
her, hope for the same happy solution of her case?
Perhaps a revolution, that once unlocks the fountains
of blood in central Germany, will be the bloodiest of
all revolutions: whereas, in our own chapters of
revolution even the stormiest, those of the Marian
Persecution and of the Parliamentary War, both
alike moved under restraints of law and legislative
policy. The very bloodiest promises of English
history have replied but feebly to the clamour and
expectations of cruel or fiery partisans. Different is
the prospect for Austria. From her, and from the
auguries of evil which becloud her else smiling atmosphere,
let us turn back to our own history in this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>sixteenth century, and for a moment make a brief
inquest into the blood that really was shed&mdash;whether
justly or not justly. Bloodshed, as an instinct&mdash;bloodshed,
as an appetite&mdash;raged like a monsoon in
the French Revolution, and many centuries before in
the Rome of Sylla and Marius&mdash;in the Rome of the
Triumvirate, and generally in the period of Proscriptions.
Too fearfully it is evident that these fits of
<i>acharnement</i> were underlaid and fed by paroxysms of
personal cruelty. In England, on the other hand,
foul and hateful as was the Marian butchery, nevertheless
it cannot be denied that this butchery rested
entirely upon principle. Homage offered to anti-Lutheran
principles, in a moment disarmed the Popish
executioner. Or if (will be the objection of the
reflecting reader)&mdash;if there are exceptions to this
rule, these must be looked for amongst the king's
enemies. And the term 'enemies' will fail to represent
adequately those who, not content with ranking
themselves wilfully amongst persons courting objects
irreconcilable to the king's interests, sought to exasperate
the displeasure of Henry by special insults,
by peculiar mortifications, and by complex ingratitude.
Foremost amongst such cases stands forward the
separate treason of Anne Boleyn, mysterious to this
hour in some of its features, rank with pollutions
such as European prejudice would class with Italian
enormities, and by these very pollutions&mdash;literally by
and through the very excess of the guilt&mdash;claiming
to be incredible. Neither less nor more than this
which follows is the logic put into the mouth of the
Lady Anne Boleyn:&mdash;From the mere enormity of the
guilt imputed to me, from that very abysmal stye of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>incestuous adultery in which now I wallow, I challenge
as of right the presumption that I am innocent; for
the very reason that I am loaded in my impeachment
with crimes that are inhuman, I claim to be no
criminal at all. Because my indictment is revolting
and monstrous, therefore is it incredible. The case,
taken apart from the person, would not (unless
through its mysteriousness and imperfect circumstantiation)
have attracted the interest which <i>has</i> given
it, and <i>will</i> in all time coming continue to give it, a
root in history amongst insoluble or doubtfully soluble
historical problems. The <i>case</i>, being painful and
shocking, would by readers generally have long since
been dismissed to darkness. But the <i>person</i>, too
critically connected with a vast and immortal revolution,
will for ever call back the case before the
tribunals of earth. The mother of Queen Elizabeth,
the mother of Protestantism in England, cannot be
suffered&mdash;never <i>will</i> be suffered&mdash;to benefit by that
shelter of merciful darkness which, upon any humbler
person, or even upon this person in any humbler case,
might be suffered to settle quietly as regards the
memory of her acts. Mr. Froude, a pure-minded
man, is the last man to call back into the glare of a
judicial inquest deeds of horror, over which eternal
silence should have brooded, had such an issue been
possible. But three centuries of discussion have
made <i>that</i> more and more impossible. And now,
therefore, with a view to the improvement of the
dispute, and, perhaps, in one or two instances, with a
chance for the rectification of the '<i>issues</i>' (speaking
juridically) into which the question has been allowed
to lapse, Mr. Froude has in some degree re-opened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>the discussion. 'The guilt,' he says, 'must rest
where it is due. But under any hypothesis guilt
there <i>was</i>&mdash;dark, mysterious, and most miserable.'</p>

<p>Tell this story how you may, and the evidence
remains of guilt under <i>any</i> hypothesis&mdash;guilt such as
in Grecian tragedy was seen thousands of years ago
hanging in clouds of destiny over princely houses,
and reading to them a doom of utter ruin, root and
branch, in which, as in the anarchy of hurricanes, no
form or feature was descried distinctly&mdash;nothing but
some dim fluctuating phantom, pointing with recording
finger to that one ancestral crime through which the
desolation had been wrought.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude, through his natural sense of justice,
and his deep study of the case, is unfavourably disposed
towards the Lady Anne Boleyn: nevertheless
he retains lingering doubts on her behalf, all of which,
small and great, we have found reason to dismiss.
We, for our parts, are thoroughly convinced of her
guilt. Our faith is, that no shadow of any ground
exists for suspending the verdict of the sentence; but
at the same time for mitigating that sentence there
arose this strong argument&mdash;namely, that amongst
women not formally pronounced idiots, there never
can have been one more pitiably imbecile.</p>

<p>There is a mystery hanging over her connection
with the king which nobody has attempted to disperse.
We will ourselves suggest a few considerations that
may bring a little coherency amongst the scattered
glimpses of her fugitive court life. The very first
thought that presents itself, is a sentiment, that
would be pathetic in the case of a person entitled to
more respect, upon the brevity of her public career.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Apparently she lost the king's favour almost in the
very opening of her married life. But in what way?
Not, we are persuaded, through the king's caprice.
There was hardly time for caprice to have operated;
and her declension in favour from that cause would
have been gradual. Time there was none for her
beauty to decay&mdash;neither <i>had</i> it decayed. We are
disposed to think that in a very early stage of her
intercourse with the king, she had irritated the king
by one indication of mental imbecility rarely understood
even amongst medical men&mdash;namely, the
offensive habit of laughing profusely without the
least sense of anything ludicrous or comic. Oxford,
or at least one of those who shot at the Queen, was
signally distinguished by this habit. Without reason
or pretext, he would break out into causeless laughter,
not connected with any impulse that he could explain.
With this infirmity Anne Boleyn was plagued in
excess. On the 2nd of May, 1536, the very first day
on which she was made aware of the dreadful accusations
hanging over her good name and her life, on
being committed to the Tower, and taken by Sir
William Kingston, the governor, to the very same
chambers in which she had lain at the period of her
coronation, she said, 'It' (meaning the suite of rooms)
'is too good for me; Jesu, have mercy on me;' next
she kneeled down, 'weeping a great space.' Such are
Sir William's words; immediately after which he
adds, 'and in the same sorrow fell into a great
laughing.' A day or two later than this, she said,
'Master Kingston, shall I die without justice?'&mdash;meaning,
it seems, would she be put to death without
any judicial examination of her case; upon which Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
William replied, 'The poorest subject the king hath,
had justice'&mdash;meaning, that previously to such an
examination of his case, he could not by regular
course of justice be put to death. Such was the
question of the prisoner&mdash;such was the answer of the
king's representative. What occasion was here
suggested for rational laughter? And yet laughter
was her sole comment. 'Therewith,' says Sir William,
'she laughed.' On May 18th, being the day next
before that of her execution, she said, 'Master
Kingston, I hear say I shall not die afore noon; and
I am very sorry therefore, for I thought to be dead
by this time, and past my pain.' Upon this Sir
William assured her 'it should be no pain, it was so
subtle;' meaning that the stroke of a sword by a
powerful arm, applied to a slender neck, could not
meet resistance enough to cause any serious pain.
She replied, 'I heard say the executioner was very
good, and I have a little neck;' after which she
laughed heartily. Sir William so much misunderstood
this laughter, which was doubtless of the same
morbid and idiotic character as all the previous cases,
that he supposes her to have had 'much joy and
pleasure in death,' which is a mere misconstruction of
the case. Even in the very act of dying she could
not check her smiling, which assuredly was as morbid
in its quality and origin as what of old was known as
'<i>risus sardonicus</i>.'</p>

<p>Carrying along with us, therefore, a remembrance
of this repulsive habit, which argues a silliness so
constitutional, and noting also the obstinate (almost
it might be called the brutal) folly with which, during
the last seventeen days of her life, she persisted in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>criminating herself, volunteering a continued rehearsal
of conversations the most profligate, under a mere
instinct of gossiping, we shall begin to comprehend
the levity which no doubt must have presided in her
conversations with the king. Too evidently in a
court but recently emerging from barbarism, there
was a shocking defect of rules or fixed ceremonial for
protecting the dignity of the queen and of her female
attendants. The settlement of any such rules
devolved upon the queen herself, in default of any
traditional system; and unhappily here was a queen
without sense, without prudence, without native and
sexual dignity for suggesting or upholding such
restraints, and whose own breeding and experience
had been purely French. Strange it was that the
king's good sense, or even his jealousy, had not
peremptorily enjoined, as a caution of mere decency,
the constant presence of some elderly matrons, uniting
rank and station with experience and good sense.
But not the simplest guarantees for ordinary decorum
were apparently established in the royal household.
And the shocking spectacle was daily to be seen, of a
young woman, singularly beautiful, atrociously silly,
and without common self-respect, styling herself
Queen of England, yet exacting no more respect or
homage than a housemaid, suffering young men, the
most licentious in all England, openly to speculate on
the contingency of her husband's death, to talk of it
in language the coarsest, as 'waiting for dead men's
shoes,' and bandying to and fro the chances that this
man or that man, according to the whim of the
morning, should 'have her,' or should <i>not</i> 'have her'&mdash;that
is, have the reversion of the queen's person as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>a derelict of the king. All this, though most injurious
to her prospects, was made known by Anne Boleyn
herself to the female companions who were appointed
to watch her revelations in prison. And certainly no
chambermaid ever rehearsed her own colloquies with
these vile profligates in a style of thinking more abject
than did at this period the female majesty of England.
Listening to no accuser, but simply to the unsolicited
revelations of the queen herself, as she lay in bed
amongst her female attendants in the Tower, every
man of sense becomes aware, that if these presumptuous
young libertines abstained from daily
proposals to the queen of the most criminal nature,
<i>that</i> could arise only from the reserve and suspicion
incident to a state of rivalship, and not from any
deference paid to the queen's personal pretensions, or
to her public character.</p>

<p>Three years, probably one-half of that term, had
seen the beginning, the decay, and the utter extinction
of the king's affection for Anne. It is known now,
and at the time it had furnished a theme for conjecture,
that very soon after his marriage the king
manifested uneasiness, and not long after angry
suspicions, upon matters connected with the queen.
We have no doubt that she herself, whilst seeking to
amuse the king with fragments of her French experiences,
had, through mere oversight and want of tact,
unintentionally betrayed the risks to which her
honour had been at times exposed. Without presence
of mind, without inventive talent or rapidity of
artifice, she would often compromise herself, and
overshoot her momentary purposes of furnishing
amusement to the king. He had heard too much.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
He believed no longer in her purity. And very soon,
as a natural consequence, she ceased to interest him.
The vague wish to get rid of her would for some time
suggest no hopeful devices towards such a purpose.
For some months, apparently, he simply neglected
her. This neglect unhappily it was that threw her
unprotected upon the vile society of young libertines.
Two of these&mdash;Sir Henry Norris and Sir Francis
Weston&mdash;had been privileged friends of the king.
But no restraints of friendship or of duty had checked
their designs upon the queen. Either special words,
or special acts, had been noticed and reported to the
king. Thenceforward a systematic watch had been
maintained upon all parties. Discoveries more
shocking than anybody looked for had been made.
The guilty parties had been careless: blind themselves,
they thought all others blind; but, during
the April of 1536, the Privy Council had been
actively engaged in digesting and arranging the
information received.</p>

<p>On May-day, the most gladsome day in the whole
year, according to the usages of that generation, the
dreadful news transpired of the awful accusations and
the impending trials. Smeton, a musician, was the
only person not of gentlemanly rank amongst the
accused. He was accused of adultery with the
queen; and he confessed the offence; never retracting
that part of his confession. In discussing the
probabilities of the case, it is necessary to use special
and extraordinary caution. The confession, for instance,
of Anne herself has been treated as hollow
and unmeaning; because, it is alleged, the king's
promise of indulgence and favour to her infant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>daughter was purchased under the condition of confession.
It is clear that such a traffic would not have
been available except in special and exceptional cases.
As to Smeton, he did not at all meet the king's
expectations, except as to the one point of confessing
the adultery. Consequently, as he was quite disinterested,
had nothing at all to gain, and did gain
nothing by his confession, <i>him</i> we are obliged to
believe. On the other hand, the <i>non</i>-confession of
some amongst the gentlemen, if any there were that
steadfastly adhered to this non-confession, proves
nothing at all; since <i>they</i> thought it perfidy to confess
such a case against a woman. Meantime, Constantyne,
a known friend of Sir H. Norris and of
Sir W. Brereton, two of the four gentlemen accused,
declares that, for himself, being a Protestant, and
knowing the queen's secret leaning to that party, he
and all other 'friends of the gospel' could not bring
themselves to believe that the queen had behaved so
abominably. 'As I may be saved before God,' he
says, 'I could not believe it, afore I heard them speak
at their death. But on the scaffold, in a manner <i>all</i>
confessed, unless Norris; and as to <i>him</i>, what he said
amounted to nothing.' The truth is, there occurred
in the cases of these gentlemen a dreadful struggle.
The dilemma for <i>them</i> was perhaps the most trying
upon record. Gallantry and manly tenderness forbade
any man's confessing, for a certain result of ruin to a
woman, any treasonable instances of love which she
had shown to him. Yet, on the other hand, to deny
was to rush into the presence of God with a lie upon
their lips. Hence the unintelligible character of their
final declarations. Smeton, as no gentleman, was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>hanged. All the other four&mdash;Norris, Brereton,
Weston, and Rochford&mdash;were beheaded. The four
gentlemen and Smeton suffered all on the same day&mdash;namely,
Wednesday, the 17th of May. Of all the
five, Sir W. Brereton was the only one whose guilt
was doubted. Yet he was the most emphatic in
declaring his own guilt. If he could die a thousand
deaths, he said, all would be deserved.</p>

<p>But the crime of all the rest seemed pale by the
side of Rochford's. He had been raised to the
peerage by Henry, as an expression of his kindness
to the Boleyn family. He was the brother of Anne;
and whilst the others had offended by simple adultery
with Anne, <i>his</i> crime was incestuous adultery; and
his dying words appeared (to the <i>auditors</i>), 'if not,'
says Mr. Froude, 'a confession, yet something too
nearly resembling it.'</p>

<p>From such dreadful offences, all readers are glad
to hurry away; yet in one respect this awful impeachment
has a reconciling effect. No reader after
this wishes for further life to Anne. For her own
sake it is plain that through death must lie the one
sole peaceful solution of her unhappy and erring life.
Some people have most falsely supposed that the case
against the brother and sister, whatever might be
pronounced upon the four other cases, laboured under
antecedent improbabilities so great as to vitiate, or
to load with suspicion, the entire case of the Privy
Council. But, on the contrary, the shocking monstrosity
of the charge strengthens the anti-Boleyn
impeachment. As a means for getting rid of Anne,
the Rochford case was not at all needed. If it could
even in dreams be represented as false, the injury
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>offered to the Boleyns, whilst quite superfluous for
any purpose of Henry's, would be too atrocious an
outrage upon truth and natural justice for human
nature to tolerate. The very stones would mutiny
against such a calumny coming as a crown or crest
to other injuries separately unendurable, if they could
once be regarded as injuries at all. Under these
circumstances, what should we think of a call upon
Lord Berkshire, the very father of Anne Boleyn, to
sit as one of the judges upon the cases. Not, indeed,
upon the cases of his son and his daughter; from
such Roman trials of fortitude he was excused; but
on the other cases he was required to officiate as one
of the judges. And, in fact, the array of rank and
splendour, as exhibited in the persons of those who
composed the court, surpassed anything previously
known in England. On the part of the crown, it
was too keenly felt that the deep personal interest of
the king, in obtaining liberty to form a new marriage
connection with Jane Seymour, would triumphantly
outweigh all the justice that ever could be arrayed
against the two Boleyns. Nothing could win a
moment's audience for the royal cause, except an unparalleled
and matchless splendour in the composition
of the court. This, therefore, was secured. Pretty
nearly the whole peerage of that period was embattled
upon the bench of judges.</p>

<p>Meantime, the tragedy, so far as the queen is
concerned, took a turn which convicts all parties of a
blunder; of a blunder the most needless and superfluous.
This blunder was exposed by Bishop Burnet
about a hundred and fifty years later, but most
insufficiently exposed; and to this hour it has not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>been satisfactorily cleared up. Let us pursue the
arrears of the case. The four gentlemen, together
with Mark Smeton, were executed (as we have seen)
on Wednesday, the 17th of May, 1536. Two days
later Queen Anne Boleyn was brought out at noonday
upon the verdant lawn within the Tower, and with
very slight ceremonies she suffered decapitation. A
single cannon-shot proclaimed to London and Westminster
the final catastrophe of this unhappy romance.
Anne had offered not one word of self-vindication on
this memorable occasion; and, if her motive to so
signal a forbearance were really consideration for the
interests of her infant daughter, it must be granted
that she exhibited, in the farewell act of her life, a
grandeur of self-conquest which no man could have
anticipated. For this act she has never received the
homage which she deserved; whilst, on the other
hand, praise most unmerited has been given for three
centuries to the famous letter of self-defence which
she is reputed to have addressed to the king at the
opening of her trial. This letter, beyond all doubt
a forgery, was first brought into effectual notice by
the <i>Spectator</i> somewhere about 1710; and, whether
authentic or not, is most injudiciously composed. It
consists of five paragraphs, each one of which is
pulling distractedly in contradictory directions.</p>

<p>Meantime, that or any other act of Anne Boleyn's
was superseded by a fatal discovery, which changed
utterly the relations of all parties, which in effect
acquitted Anne of treason, and which summarily
rehabilitated as untainted subjects of the king those
five men who had suffered death in the character of
traitors. The marriage of Anne to the king, it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>suddenly discovered, had from the beginning been
void. It is true that we have long ceased to accredit
those objections from precontracts, &amp;c., which in the
papal courts would be held to establish a nullity. But
we are to proceed by the laws as then settled. Grounds
of scruple, which would now raise at most a mere case
of irregularity, at that time, unless met <i>ab initio</i> by
a papal dispensation, did legally constitute a flaw
such as even a friendly pope could not effectually
cure; far less that angry priest, blazing up with
wrath, and at intervals meditating an interdict, who
at present occupied the chair of St. Peter. Here was
a discovery to make, after so much irreparable injustice
had been already perpetrated! If (which is
too certain), under the marriage laws then valid,
Anne Boleyn never had been the lawful wife of
Henry, then, as Bishop Burnet suddenly objected
when too late by one hundred and fifty years, what
became of the adultery imputed to Anne, and the five
young courtiers? Not being the king's wife, both
<i>she</i> was incapable in law of committing adultery as
against the king, and by an inevitable consequence
<i>they</i> were incapable of participating in a crime which
she was incapable of committing.</p>

<p>When was this fatal blunder detected? Evidently
before any of the victims had become cold in their
graves. And the probability is&mdash;that, when the
blunder was first perceived, the dreadful consequences
of that blunder, and the legal relations of those consequences,
were not immediately discerned. What
convinces us of this is, that the first impulse of the
king and his advisers, upon discovering through a
secret communication made by Anne the existence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>a precontract, and the consequent vitiation of her
marriage with the king, had been, to charge upon
Anne a new and scandalous offence. Not until they
had taken time to review the case, did they become
aware of the injustice that had been perpetrated by
their own precipitance: and as this was past all
reparation, probably it was agreed amongst the few
who were parties to the fatal oversight, that the
safest course was to lock up the secret in darkness.
But it is singular to watch the fatality of error which
pursued this ill-starred marriage. Every successive
critic, in exposing the errors of his predecessor, has
himself committed some fresh blunder. Bishop
Burnet, for instance, first of all in a Protestant age
indicated the bloody mistakes of papal lawyers in
1536; not meaning at all to describe these mistakes
as undetected by those who were answerable for them.
Though hushed up, they were evidently known to
their unhappy authors. Next upon Burnet, down
comes Mr. Froude. Burnet had shaped his criticism
thus: 'If,' he says, 'the queen was not married to
the king, there was no adultery.' Certainly not.
But, says Mr. Froude, Burnet forgets that she was
condemned for conspiracy and incest, as well as for
adultery. Then thirdly come we, and reverting to
this charge of forgetfulness upon Burnet, we say,
Forgets! but how was he bound to remember? The
conspiracy, the incest, the adultery, all alike vanish
from the record exactly as the character of wife
vanishes from Anne. With any or all of these
crimes Henry had no right to intermeddle. They
were the crimes of one who never had borne any
legal relation to him; crimes, therefore, against her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>own conscience, but not against the king in any
character that he was himself willing permanently to
assume.</p>

<p>On this particular section of Henry's reign, the
unhappy episode of his second wife, Mr. Froude has
erred by insufficient rigour of justice. Inclined to
do more justice than is usually done to the king, and
not blind to the dissolute character of Anne, he has
yet been carried, by the pity inalienable from the
situation, to concede more to the pretences of doubt
and suspense than is warranted by the circumstances
of the case. Anne Boleyn was too surely guilty up
to the height of Messalina's guilt, and far beyond
that height in one atrocious instance.</p>

<p>Passing from <i>that</i> to the general pretensions of
this very eloquent and philosophic book, we desire to
say&mdash;that Mr. Froude is the first writer (first and
sole) who has opened his eyes to comprehend the
grandeur of this tremendous reign.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In now reproducing the three series of notes on the
Indian Mutiny written by <span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> for me in
<i>Titan</i>, I must advert briefly to the agony of apprehension
under which the two earlier chapters were
written. I can never forget the intense anxiety with
which he studied daily the columns of <i>The Scotsman</i>
and <i>The Times</i>, looking wistfully for tidings from
Roorkhee where his daughter <span class="smcap">Florence</span> was shut up.
The father's heart was on the rack until news arrived
that the little garrison was saved.</p>

<p>The following paragraph from a letter written to
his daughter <span class="smcap">Emily</span> on Sunday, December 1st, 1857,
will give some idea of the tension of that terrible
suspense:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">India.</span>&mdash;Up to the last mail but one (or briefly in
its Latin form, up to the penultimate mail), I suffered
in my nervous system to an extent that (except
once, in 1812) had not experimentally been made
known to me as a possibility. Every night, oftentimes
all night long, I had the same dream&mdash;a vision
of children, most of them infants, but not all, the
<i>first</i> rank being girls of five and six years old, who
were standing in the air outside, but so as to touch
the window; and I heard, or perhaps fancied that I
heard, always the same dreadful word <i>Delhi</i>, not then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>knowing that a word even more dreadful&mdash;- Cawnpore&mdash;was
still in arrear. This fierce shake to my
nerves caused almost from the beginning a new
symptom to expose itself (of which previously I never
had the faintest outline), viz. somnambulism; and
now every night, to my great alarm, I wake up
to find myself at the window, which is sixteen feet
from the nearest side of the bed. The horror was
unspeakable from the hell-dog Nena or Nana; how
if this fiend should get hold of <span class="smcap">Florence</span> or her baby
(now within seventeen days of completing her half
year)? What first gave me any relief was a good
firm-toned letter, dated <i>Rourkee</i>,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> in the public journals,
from which it was plain that <i>Rourkee</i> had found
itself able to act aggressively.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> had reason to be proud of his son-in-law,
<span class="smcap">Colonel Baird Smith</span>, whose varied and brilliant
services, culminating at the siege of Delhi, are
written in the pages of <span class="smcap">Sir John Kaye's</span> and <span class="smcap">Colonel
Malleson's</span> <i>History of the Sepoy War</i>.</p>

<p>On that fateful day at Delhi, when so much hung
upon the decision as to whether the British should
hold the ground they had won in the first assault, it
is not too much to say that 'the splendid obstinacy'
of <span class="smcap">Baird Smith</span> practically saved India.</p>

<p>I throw together a few passages from the thrilling
pages where the story is told&mdash;sufficient to enable
the reader who comes fresh to the subject, to understand
what manner of man this gallant engineer was
who made his mark on British India.</p>

<p>R&uacute;rki (or Roorkhee) was the head-quarters of the
Engineering Science of the country. When the
news came of the Delhi massacre, <span class="smcap">Baird Smith</span> instantly
made 'admirable arrangements for the defence
of the great engineering depot, in which he took such
earnest and loving interest. Officially, he was superintendent
of irrigation in the north-western provinces&mdash;a
most useful functionary, great in all the
arts of peace, and with a reputation which any man
might be proud to possess. But the man of much
science now grew at once into the man of war, and
R&uacute;rki became a garrison under his command. Not
an hour was lost.'</p>

<hr />

<p>His timely express to <span class="smcap">Major Charles Reid</span> to bring
his men on by the Ganges Canal route instead of by
forced marches was an early evidence of his combination
of dash and sound judgment. <span class="smcap">Reid</span> said, that
it saved the place and the lives of the ladies and
children.</p>

<p>From the hour that he made his appearance before
Delhi as Chief Engineer, a succession of incidents
stand on record which show his skill and courage.
On the first occasion of <span class="smcap">Brigadier-General Wilson</span>
consulting him professionally, 'he threw all the
earnestness of his nature into a great remonstrance
against the project of withdrawal. He told the
General that to raise the siege would be fatal to our
national interests. 'It is our duty,' he said, 'to
retain the grip which we now have upon Delhi, and
to hold on like Grim Death until the place is our
own.' He argued it ably. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> listened, and was
convinced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>In that supreme moment at the storming of Delhi,
when the repulse of two columns, the heavy losses,
and the great strength of the place caused the
General to hesitate whether to continue the operations,
England had cause to feel thankful for the
tenacity and daring of two of her sons:&mdash;</p>

<p>'From this fatal determination <span class="smcap">General Wilson</span>
was saved by the splendid obstinacy of <span class="smcap">Baird
Smith</span>, aided by the soldier-like instincts of <span class="smcap">Neville
Chamberlain</span>.... The General undoubtedly
believed that the safety of the army would be compromised
by the retention of the positions they had
gained. Fortunately, <span class="smcap">Baird Smith</span> was at his elbow.
Appealed to by <span class="smcap">General Wilson</span> as to whether he
thought it possible for the army to retain the ground
they had won, his answer was short and decisive,
"We <i>must</i> do so!" That was all. But the uncompromising
tone, the resolute manner, the authority
of the speaker, combined to make it a decision against
which there was no appeal. <span class="smcap">General Wilson</span>
accepted it.... It is not too much to
affirm, that a retrograde movement would, for the
time, have lost India.'</p>

<hr />

<p>In spite of the sufferings attendant on a severe
wound, the indomitable spirit of this brave soldier
carried him through all trials until India was practically
saved. Then, shattered by his many exertions,
the breathing time came too late. His career is
thus summed up in the following inscription on his
tomb in Calcutta Cathedral:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Colonel Richard Baird Smith</span> of the Bengal
Engineers, Master of the Calcutta Mint, C.B. and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
A.D.C. to the Queen, whose career, crowded with
brilliant service, cut short at its brightest, was born
at Lasswade on the 31st of December, 1818. He
went to India in 1836. Already distinguished in the
two Sikh wars, his conduct on the outbreak of revolt
in 1857 showed what a clear apprehension, a stout
heart, and a hopeful spirit could effect with scanty
means in crushing disorder. Called to Delhi as chief
engineer, his bold and ready judgment, his weighty
and tenacious counsels, played a foremost part in
securing the success of the siege and England's
supremacy. The gathered wisdom of many years
spent in administering the irrigation of Upper India,
trained him for his crowning service&mdash;the survey of
the great famine of 1861, the provision of relief, and
the suggestions of safeguards against such calamities.
Broken by accumulated labours, he died at sea, Dec. 13,
1861, aged scarcely 43 years. At Madras, where his
Indian career began, his body awaits the resurrection.'</p>

<p>His great work, the <i>Report on Italian Irrigation</i>,
published with maps and plans in 1852, remains a
monument of his engineering ability. <span class="smcap">Colonel Baird

<h3>HURRIED NOTICES OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>September, 1857.</i>)</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>From the foundations of the earth, no case in
human action or suffering has occurred which could
less need or less tolerate the aid of artificial rhetoric
than that tremendous tragedy which now for three
months long has been moving over the plains of
Hindostan. What in Grecian days were called <i>aporreta</i>
(&#945;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#8165;&#951;&#964;&#945;), things not utterable in human language
or to human ears&mdash;things ineffable&mdash;things to be
whispered&mdash;things to dream of, not to tell<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>&mdash;these
things amongst high-caste Brahmims, and amongst the
Rajapoots, or martial race of heroes; have been the
common product of the passing hour.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Is this well?
Is this a fitting end for the mighty religious system
that through countless generations has overshadowed
India? Yes, it <i>is</i> well: it <i>is</i> a fitting end for that
man-destroying system, more cruel than the bloody
religions of Mexico, which, for the deification of the
individual, made hopeless Helots of the multitude.
Henceforward <span class="smcap">CASTE</span> <i>must</i> virtually be at an end.
Upon <i>caste</i> has our Bengal army founded a final treason
bloodier and larger than any known to human annals.
Now, therefore, mere instincts of self-preservation&mdash;mere
shame&mdash;mere fiery stress of necessity, will compel
our East India Directory (or whatsoever power
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>may now under parliamentary appointment inherit
their responsibilities) to proscribe, once and for ever,
by steadfast exclusion from all possibility of a martial
career&mdash;to ruin by <i>legal</i> degradation and incapacities,
all Hindoo pretensions to places of trust, profit, or
public dignity which found themselves upon high
caste, as Brahmins or Rajapoots. Yes, it <i>is</i> well that
the high-<i>caste</i> men, who existed only for the general
degradation of their own Hindoo race in humbler
stations, have themselves severed the links which
connected them with the glory (so unmerited for
<i>them</i>) of a nobler Western nationality. Bought
though it is by earthly ruin, by torment, many times
by indignities past utterance inflicted upon our dear
massacred sisters, and upon their unoffending infants,
yet for that very reason we must now maintain the
great conquest so obtained. There is no man living
so base&mdash;no, there is not a felon living amongst us, who
could be persuaded to repeat the act of the Grecian
leader Agamemnon&mdash;namely, to sacrifice his innocent
daughter, just entering the portals of life in its most
golden stage, on the miserable pretence of winning
a <i>public</i> benefit; masking a diabolical selfishness by
the ostentation of public spirit. Yet if some calamity,
or even some atrocity, <i>had</i> carried off the innocent
creature under circumstances which involved an advantage
to her country, or to coming generations,
the most loving father might gradually allow himself
to draw consolation from the happy consequences of
a crime which he would have died to prevent. Even
such a mixed necessity of feeling presses upon ourselves
at present. From the bloody graves of our
dear martyred sisters, scattered over the vast plains
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>of India, rises a solemn adjuration to the spiritual ear
of Him that listens with understanding. Audibly
this spiritual voice says: O dear distant England!
mighty to save, were it not that in the dreadful hour
of our trial thou wert far away, and heardest not the
screams of thy dying daughters and of their perishing
infants. Behold! for us all is finished! We from
our bloody graves, in which all of us are sleeping to
the resurrection, send up united prayers to thee, that
upon the everlasting memory of our hell-born wrongs,
thou, beloved mother, wouldst engraft a counter-memory
of everlasting retribution, inflicted upon the
Moloch idolatries of India. Upon the pride of <i>caste</i>
rests for its ultimate root all this towering tragedy,
which now hides the very heavens from India. Grant,
therefore, O distant, avenging England&mdash;grant the
sole commensurate return which to us <i>can</i> be granted&mdash;us
women and children that trod the fields of carnage
alone&mdash;grant to our sufferings the virtue and
lasting efficacy of a <i>lutron</i> (&#955;&#965;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;), or ransom paid
down on behalf of every creature groaning under the
foul idol of caste. Only by the sufferance of England
can that idolatry prosper. Thou, therefore, England,
when Delhi is swept by the ploughshare and sown
with salt, build a solitary monument to us; and on
its base inscribe that the last and worst of the murderous
idolatries which plagued and persecuted the
generations of men was by us abolished; and that by
women and children was the pollution of caste cleansed
from the earth for ever!</p>

<hr />

<p>Now let us descend into the circumstantialities
of the case, explaining what may have been obscure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>to the general reader. By which term <i>general reader</i>
is meant, that reader who has had no reason for
cultivating any acquaintance whatever with India;
to whom, therefore, the whole subject is unbroken
ground; and who neither knows, nor pretends to
know, the merest outline of our British connection
with India; what first carried us thither; what
accidents of good luck and of imminent peril raised
us from a mere commercial to a political standing;
how we improved this standing by prodigious energy
into the position of a conquering state; prospered
rapidly by the opposition which we met; overthrew
even our European competitors, of whom the deadliest
were the French; pursued a difficult war with an able
Mahometan upstart, Hyder Ali&mdash;a treacherous and
cruel prince; next with his son, Tippoo Sahib, a still
more ferocious scoundrel, who, in his second war with
us, was settled effectually by one thrust of a bayonet
in the hands of an English soldier. This war, and
the consequent division of Tippoo's dominions, closed
the eighteenth century. About 1817 we undertook
the great Mahratta war; the victorious termination
of which placed us, after sixty years of struggle, in
the supreme rank amongst Indian potentates. All
the rest of our power and greatness accrued to us by
a natural and spontaneous evolution of consequences,
most of which would have followed us as if by some
magnetic attraction, had we ourselves been passive.
No conquering state was ever yet so mild and beneficent
in the spirit of its government, or so free
from arrogance in its demeanour. An impression
thoroughly false prevails even amongst ourselves,
that we have pursued a systematic course of usurpations,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>and have displaced all the <i>ancient</i> thrones of
Hindostan. Unfortunately for this representation,
it happens that all the leading princes of India whose
power and rank brought them naturally into collision
with ourselves, could not be ancient, having been
originally official dependants upon the great Tartar
prince, whose throne was usually at Agra or Delhi,
and whom we called sometimes the Emperor, or the
Shah, or more often the <i>Great Mogul</i>. During the
decay of the Mogul throne throughout the eighteenth
century, these dependent princes had, by continual
encroachments on the weakness of their sovereign,
made themselves independent rulers; but they could
not be older than the great Mogul Shah himself, who
had first created them. Now the Mogul throne was
itself a mere modern creation, owing its birth to
Baber, the great-grandson of Tamerlane. But Baber,
the eldest of these Tartar princes, synchronised with
our English Henry VIII. In reality, there was
nothing old in India that could be displaced by us;
at least amongst the Mahometan princes. Some
ancient Hindoo Rajahs there were in obscure corners,
but without splendour of wealth or military distinction;
and the charge of usurpation was specially
absurd, since we pre-eminently were the king-makers,
the king-supporters, the king-pensioners, in Hindostan;
and excepting the obscure princes just mentioned,
almost every Indian prince, at the time of our
opening business in the political line, happened to be
a usurper. We ourselves made the Rajah of Oude
into a king; we ourselves more than once saved the
supreme Shah (<i>i. e.</i> the Great Mogul) from military
ruin, and for many a year saved <i>him</i> and <i>his</i> from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>the painful condition of insolvency. But all this is
said in the way of parenthesis. In another number, a
sketch of our Indian Empire, in its growth and early
oscillations, may be presented to the reader, specially
adapted to the use of those whose reading has not
lain in that direction. Now let us return to the
great domineering question of the hour&mdash;the present
tremendous revolt on the part of seventy or eighty
thousand men in our Bengal Presidency.</p>

<p>This mutiny we propose to notice briefly but searchingly
under three heads&mdash;first, in its relation to the
mutineers themselves; next, in its relation to ourselves;
but, subdividing that question, we will assign
the second head to the consideration of its probable
bearing on our political credit and reputation; whilst
the third head may be usefully given to the consideration
of its bearing on our pecuniary interests, and
our means of effectual reparation for the ruins left
behind by rebellion, and by the frantic spasms of
blind destruction.</p>

<p>First, then, let us look for a moment at this great
tumultuary movement, as it points more or less
obscurely to the ulterior purposes of the mutineers,
and the temper in which they pursue those purposes.
In a newspaper of Saturday, August 15, we observe
the following sentence introductory to a most unsatisfactory
discussion of the Indian revolt:&mdash;'The mutiny
in India, from the uninterrupted nature of its progress,
and its rapid spread through every considerable
station, shows a power of combination and determination
which has never before been given credit
for to the native Indian mind.' This passage is cited
by us, not for anything plausible in its views, but for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>the singular felicity of contradiction which fortunately
it offers to every indication of the true disposable
ability that is now, or ever has been, at the service
of the insurgents. This, indeed, is rapidly becoming
of very subordinate importance; since the ablest
rebel, without an army, must be contemptible enough.
But with a view to the larger question&mdash;What quality
of opposition is ever likely to be brought into play
against us, not in merely military displays, but in
the secret organisation of plots and local tumults,
propagated over extensive provinces? Some degree
of anxiety is reasonable under any possible condition
of the army; and this being so, it is satisfactory to
observe, now in 1857, the same childishness and defect
of plan and coherent purpose as have ever characterised
the oriental mind. No foresight has been
exhibited; no concert between remote points; no
preparation; no tendency towards combined action.
And, on the other hand, it is most justly noticed by
a new London paper, of the same date&mdash;namely, the
<i>People</i>&mdash;that it is perfectly dazzling to the mind to
review over the whole face of India, under almost
universal desertion, the attitude of erectness and preparation
assumed by the scattered parties of our noble
countrymen&mdash;'everywhere' (says the <i>People</i>) 'driven
to bay, and everywhere turning upon and scattering
all assailants. From all parts is the same tale. No
matter how small the amount of the British force
may be, if it were but a captain's company, it holds
its own.' On the other hand, what single success
have the rebels achieved? Most valiant, no doubt,
they have shown themselves in hacking to pieces poor
fugitive women, most intrepid in charging a column
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>of infants. Else, what have they to show? Delhi is
the solitary post which they have for the moment
secured; but even that through the incomprehensible
failure of the authorities at Meerut, and not through
any vigour manifested by themselves. Any uneasiness
which still possesses the minds of close observers
fastens upon these two points&mdash;first, upon the disarmings,
as distinguished from the desertions; secondly,
upon the amount, and probable equipment, and supposed
route of stragglers. It is now said that the
mutiny has burned itself out from mere defect of
fuel; there <i>can</i> be no more revolts of sepoys, seeing
that no sepoys now remain to revolt; that is, of the
Bengal force. But in this general statement a great
distinction is neglected. Regiments once disarmed,
if also <i>stripped of their private arms</i>, whether deserters
or not, are of slight account; but the grave question
is this&mdash;how many of (say seventy) regiments have
gone off <i>previously</i> to the disarming. Even in that
case, the most favourable for <i>them</i> where arms are
secured, it is true that ammunition will very soon
fail them; but still their bayonets will be available;
and we believe that the East India infantry carry
swords. A second anxiety connects itself with the
vast number of vagrant marauding soldiers, having
power to unite, and to assail small detached stations
or private bungalows. Yet, again, in cases known
specially to ourselves, the inhabitants of such small
insulated stations had rapidly fortified the buildings
best fitted for defence. Already, by the 18th of
May, in a station not far from Delhi, this had been
effected; every native servant, male or female, had
been discharged instantly; and perhaps they would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>be able to strengthen themselves with artillery. The
horrors also of the early murders at Delhi would be
likely to operate beneficially, by preventing what
otherwise is sure to happen&mdash;namely, the disposition
to relax in vigilance as first impressions wear off.
Considering, upon the whole, the amount of regiments
that may be assumed as absolutely disarmed and
neutralised; and, on the other hand, counting the
5000 and upwards of troops intercepted on their
route to Hong-Kong, and adding these to at least
25,000 of Queen's troops previously in the country,
counting also the faithful section of the Sikhs, the
Ghoorkas, and others that could be relied on, the
upshot must be, that at least 40,000 troops of the
best quality are scattered between the Hoogly and
the Sutlege (or, in other words, between Calcutta and
Loodiana<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>). Beyond a few casual outrages on some
small scale, we hope that no more of bloody tragedies
can be <i>now</i> (August 25) apprehended. But we, that
have dear friends in Bengal, must, for weeks to come,
feel restless and anxious. Still, this is a great mitigation
of the horror that besieged our anticipations
six weeks ago.</p>

<p>But, having thrown a glance at the shifting aspects
of the danger, now let us alight for a moment on the
cause of this dreadful outbreak. We have no separate
information upon this part of the subject, but we have
the results of our own vigilant observations upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>laying this and that together; and so much we will
communicate. From the first, we have rejected incredulously
the immoderate effects ascribed to the
greased cartridges; and not one rational syllable is
there in the pretended rumours about Christianising
the army. Not only is it impossible that folly so
gross should maintain itself against the unremitting
evidence of facts, all tending in the opposite direction;
but, moreover, under any such idle solution as this,
there would still remain another point unaccounted
for, and <i>that</i> is the frantic hatred borne towards ourselves
by many of the rebellious troops. Some of our
hollow friends in France, Belgium, &amp;c., profess to read
in this hatred an undeniable inference that we must
have treated the sepoys harshly, else how explain an
animosity so deadly. To that argument we have a
very brief answer, such as seems decisive. The
Bengalese sepoy,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> when most of all pressed for some
rational explanation of his fury, never once thought
of <i>this</i> complaint; besides which, it is too notorious
that our fault has always lain the other way. Heavily
criminal, in fact, we had been by our lax discipline;
and in particular, the following most scandalous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>breach of discipline must have been silently connived
at for years by British authorities. Amongst the
outward forms of respect between man and man, there
is none that has so indifferently belonged to all
nations, as the act of rising from a sedentary posture
for the purpose of expressing respect. Most other
forms of respect have varied with time and with
place. The ancient Romans, for instance, never
bowed; and amongst orientals, you are thought to
offer an insult if you uncover your head. In this
little England of ours, who could fancy two stout men
curtseying to each other? Yet this they did, and so
recently as in Shakspere's days. To use his words,
they 'crook'd the pregnant hinges of the knee.'
Sometimes they curtseyed with the right knee singly,
sometimes with both, as did Romeo to the fiery
Tybalt. Many and rapid, therefore, were the changes
in ceremonial forms, at least with us, the changeable
men of Christendom; else how could it happen that,
two hundred and fifty years back, men of rank in
England should have saluted each other by forms
that now would be thought to indicate lunacy? And
yet, violent as the spirit of change might otherwise
be, one thing never changed&mdash;the expression of respect
between man and man by rising from their seats.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Utque viro sancto <i>chorus assurrexerit</i> omnis'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is a record belonging to the eldest of days; and that
it belonged not to the eldest times only, but also to
the highest rank, is involved in a memorable anecdote
from the last days of Julius C&aelig;sar. He, the mighty
dictator&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Yes, he, the foremost man of all this world'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p><p>actually owed his assassination, under one representation,
to the burning resentment of his supposed
aristocratic hauteur in a public neglect of this very
form. A deputation of citizens, on a matter of
business, had found him seated, and to their immeasurable
disgust, he had made no effort even to
rise. His friends excused him on the allegation,
whether true or not, that at the moment he was
physically incapacitated from rising by a distressing
infirmity. It might be so: as Shakspere elsewhere
observes, the black silk patch knows best whether
there is a wound underneath it. But, if it were <i>not</i>
so, then the imperial man paid the full penalty of
his offence, supposing the rancorous remembrance of
that one neglect were truly and indeed what armed
the Ides of March against his life. But, were this
story as apocryphal as the legends of our nurseries,
still the bare possibility that 'the laurelled majesty'<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
of that mighty brow should have been laid low by one
frailty of this particular description&mdash;this possibility
recalls us clamorously to the treasonable character of
such an insolence, when practised systematically for
the last eighteen months by a Pagan hound, by a
sepoy from Lucknow or Benares, towards his British
commanding officer. Shall it have been possible that
the founder of the Roman empire died for having
ignored the decencies of human courtesy, perhaps
through momentary inattention, by wandering of
thoughts, or by that collapse of energy which sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>steps between our earnest intentions and their
fulfilment&mdash;this man, so august, shall he have expiated
by a bloody death one fleeting moment of forgetfulness?
and yet, on the other hand, under our Indian
government, the lowest of our servants, a mass of
carrion from a brotherhood of Thugs, shall have had
free license to insult the leaders of the army which
finds bread for him and his kindred? That the reader
may understand what it is that we are talking of&mdash;not
very long ago, in one of the courts-martial
occasioned by some explosions of tentative insubordination
preliminary to the grand revolt, a British officer,
holding the rank of lieutenant, made known to the
court, that through the last twelve or eighteen
months he had been struck and shocked by one
alarming phenomenon within the cantonments of the
sepoys: formerly, on his entering the lines, the men
had risen respectfully from their seats as he walked
along; but since 1854, or thereabouts, they had
insolently looked him in the face, whilst doggedly
retaining their seats. Now this was a punishable
breach of discipline, which in our navy <i>would</i> be
punished without fail. Even a little middy, fresh
from the arms of his sisters or his nurse, and who
does not bear any royal commission, as an ensign or
cornet in the army, is thus supported in the performance
of his duty, and made respectable in the eyes of
his men, though checked in all explosions of childish
petulance&mdash;even to this child, as an officer in command,
respect is exacted; and on the finest arena of discipline
ever exhibited to the world, it is habitually
felt that from open disrespect to the ruin of all
discipline the steps of descent are rapid. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>important fact in evidence as to the demeanour of
the sepoy, throws a new light upon the whole revolt.
Manifestly it had been moulding and preparing itself
for the last two years, or more. And those authorities
who had tolerated Colonel Wheler for months,
might consistently tolerate this presumption in the
sepoy for a year.</p>

<hr />

<p>We had, in reliance upon receiving fuller materials
for discussion by the Eastern mail <i>arriving</i> in the
middle of August, promised by anticipation two heads
for our review, which, under the imperfect explanations
received, we are compelled to defer. Meantime,
upon each of these two heads we shall point the
attention of our readers to one or two important facts,
First, as regards the sepoy revolt considered in relation
to the future pecuniary burdens on the Bengal
exchequer, it ought to be remembered, that, if
(according to a very loose report) the Company shall
finally be found to have lost twenty millions of
rupees, or two millions sterling, by the looting of
many local treasuries, it will, on the other hand, have
saved, upon forfeited pay, and (which is much more
important) upon, forfeited pensions, in coming years,
a sum nearly corresponding. Secondly, this <i>loot</i> or
plunder must have served the public interest in a
variety of ways. It must have cramped the otherwise
free motions of the rebels; must have given
multiplied temptations to desertion; must have instilled
jealousies of each other, and want of cordial
co-operation in regard to the current plans, and
oftentimes murderous animosities in regard to past
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>transactions&mdash;divisions of spoil, or personal competitions.
Thus far, if nothing had been concerned more
precious than money, it is by no means clear that the
<i>public</i> service (as distinct from the interest of private
individuals, whose property has been destroyed) will
be found to have very seriously suffered.</p>

<p>The other head, which concerns the probable relation
of this astonishing revolt to the wisdom of our
late Indian administration, finds us, for the present,
enveloped in a mystery the most impenetrable that
history, in any of its darkest chapters, has offered.
We have a war on foot with Southern China, or
rather with Canton; and what may be the Chinese
object in that war, is hitherto an impenetrable
mystery. But darker and more unfathomable is the
mystery which invests the sepoy insurrection. Besides
the notorious fact that no grievances, the very slightest,
have been alleged, it must also be remembered
that we first and solely made a provision for the
invalided and for the superannuated soldier&mdash;a thing
unheard of throughout Asia. And this golden
reversion, the poor infatuated savages have <i>wilfully</i>
renounced! The sole <i>sure</i> result, from this most
suicidal of revolts, is&mdash;that unpitied myriads of
sepoys will be bayonetted, thousands will be hanged,
and nearly all will lose their pensions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<h3>PASSING NOTICES OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>October, 1857.</i>)</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>An English historian&mdash;one amongst many&mdash;of our
British India, having never happened to visit any
part of that vast region, nor, indeed, any part of the
East, founded upon that accident a claim to a very
favourable distinction. It was, Mr. Mill argued, desirable&mdash;it
was a splendid advantage&mdash;<span class="smcap">NOT</span> to have
seen India. This advantage he singly, amongst a
crowd of coming rivals and precursors, might modestly
plead; and to that extent he pretended to a precedency
amongst all his competitors.</p>

<p>The whole claim, and the arguments which supported
it, wore the aspect of a paradox; and a paradox
it certainly was&mdash;but not, therefore, a falsehood. A
paradox, as I have many times explained, or proposition
contradicting the <i>doxa</i> or public opinion, not
only may be true, but often has been the leading
truth in capital struggles of opinion. Not only the
true doctrine, but also, in some branches of science,
the very fundamental doctrine, that which at this day
furnishes a foundation to all the rest, originally came
forward as a violent and revolting, paradox.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>possible enough, therefore, that the Indian historiographer
may have been right, and not merely
speciously ingenious. It is something of a parallel
case, which we may all have known through the
candid admissions of the Duke of Wellington, that
the battle of Waterloo might by possibility have been
reported as satisfactorily, on the 18th of June, 1815,
from the centre of London smoke, as from the centre
of that Belgian smoke which sat in heavy clouds
throughout the day upon the field of battle. Now
and then, it is true, these Belgian clouds drew up
in solemn draperies, and revealed the great tragic
spectacle lying behind them for a brief interval.
But they closed up again, and what the spectator
saw through these fugitive openings would have
availed him little indeed, unless in so far as it was
extended and interpreted by <i>information</i> issuing from
the British staff. But this information would have
been not less material and effectual towards a history
of the mighty battle, if furnished to a man sitting
in a London drawing-room, than if furnished to a
reporter watching as an eye-witness at Hougoumont.</p>

<p>This one Waterloo illustration, if thoughtfully
applied, might yield a justification for the paradoxical
historian. Much more, therefore, might it yield a
justification for us at home, who, sitting at ten
thousand miles' distance, take upon us to better the
Indian reports written on the spot, to correct their
errors of haste, or to improve them by showing the
inferences which they authorise. We, who write
upon the awful scenes of India at far-distant stations,
do not so truly enjoy <i>unequal</i> advantages, as we enjoy
varying and <i>dissimilar</i> advantages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the old proverb, the bystander sees
more of the game than those who share too closely in
its passions. And assuredly, if it were asked, what
it is that we who write upon Indian news aspire to
effect, I may reply frankly, that, if but by a single
suggestion any one of us should add something to the
illumination of the great sepoy conspiracy&mdash;whether
as to its ultimate purpose, or as to its machinery, or
as to its wailing hopes, or if but by the merest trifle
any one of us should take away something from the
load of anxious terrors haunting the minds of all who
have relations in India&mdash;that man will have earned
his right to occupy the public ear. For my own
part, I will not lose myself at present, when so much
darkness prevails on many leading questions, in any
views too large and theoretic for our present condition
of light. And that I may not be tempted into
doing so, I will proceed without regard to any
systematic order, taking up, exactly as chance or
preponderant interest may offer them, any urgent
questions of the hour, before the progress of events
may antiquate them, or time may exhale their flavour.
This desultory and moody want of order has its
attractions for many a state of nervous distraction.
Every tenth reader may happen to share in the
distraction, so far as it has an Indian origin. The
same deadly anxiety on behalf of female relatives,
separated from their male protectors in the centre of
a howling wilderness, now dedicated as an altar to
the dark Hindoo goddess of murder, may, in the
reader also, as well as in the writer on Indian news,
periodically be called on to submit to the insurmountable
aggravation of delay. In such a case, what is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>good for one may be good for another. The same
inexpressible terrors, so long as Nena Sahibs and
other miscreant sons of hell are roaming through the
infinite darkness, may prompt the same fretfulness of
spirit; the same deadly irritation and restlessness,
which cannot but sharpen the vision of fear, will
sharpen also that of watching hope, and will continually
read elements of consolation or trust in that
which to the uninterested eye offers only a barren
blank.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>EUROPEANS.</h3>

<p>I am not sorry that the first topic, which chance
brings uppermost, is one which overflows with the
wrath of inexhaustible disgust. What fiend of
foolishness has suggested to our absurd kinsmen in
the East, through the last sixty years, to generalise
themselves under the name of <i>Europeans</i>? As if
they were ashamed of their British connections, and
precisely at that moment when they are leaving
England, they begin to assume continental airs;
when bidding farewell to Europe, they begin to style
themselves <i>Europeans</i>, as if it were a greater thing
to take up a visionary connection with the Continent,
than to found a true and indestructible nobility upon
their relationship to the one immortal island of this
planet. There is no known spot of earth which has
exerted upon the rest of the planet one-thousandth
part of the influence which this noble island has
exercised over the human race&mdash;exercised through
the noblest organs; and yet, behold! these coxcombs
of our own blood have no sooner landed on Indian
soil, than they are anxious to disclaim the connection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Such at least is the <i>apparent</i> construction of their
usage. But mark the illogical consequences which
follow. A noble British regiment suddenly, and for
no rational purpose, receives a new baptism, and
becomes a European regiment. The apologist for
this folly will say, that a British regiment does not
necessarily exclude Germans, for instance. But I
answer that it <i>does</i>. The British Government have,
during this very month of September, 1857, declared
at Frankfort (in answer to obstinate applications
from puppies who fancy that we cannot tame our
rebels without <i>their</i> assistance), '<i>that the British
army, by its constitution, does not admit foreigners</i>.'
But suppose that accidents of aristocratic patronage
have now and then privately introduced a few
Germans or Swedes into a very few regiments,
surely this accident, improbable already, was not
<i>more</i> probable when the regiment was going away
for twenty years (the old term of expatriation) to a
half-year's distance from the Rhine and the Danube.
The Germanism of the regiment might altogether
evaporate in the East, but could not possibly increase.
Next, observe this; if we must lose our nationality,
and transmute ourselves into Europeans, for the very
admirable reason that we were going away to
climates far remote from Germany, then, at least,
we ought not to call our native troops <i>sepoys</i>, but
<i>Asiatics</i>. In this way only will there be any logical
parity of antithesis. Scripturally, we are the children
of Japheth; and, as all Asiatics are the sons of Shem,
then we shall be able to mortify their conceit, by
calling to their knowledge our biblical prophecy, that
the sons of Japheth shall sit down in the tents of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Shem. But, thirdly, even thus we should find ourselves
in a dismal chaos of incoherences; for what is
to become of 'Jack'? Must our sailors be re-baptised?
Must Jack also be a <i>European</i>? Think of Admiral
Seymour reporting to the Admiralty as a leader of
Europeans! and exulting in having circumvented
Yeh by Her Majesty's European crews! And then,
lastly, come the Marines: must they also qualify for
children of Europe? Was there ever such outrageous
folly? One is sure, in the fine picturesque words of
Chaucer, that, 'for very filth and shame,' neither
admiral nor the youngest middy would disgrace
himself by such ridiculous finery from the rag-fair
of cosmopolitan swindling. The real origin of so
savage an absurdity is this:&mdash;Amongst the commercial
bodies of the three presidencies in all the
leading cities, it became a matter of difficulty often
to describe special individuals in any way legally
operative. Your wish was to distinguish him from
the native merchant or banker; but to do this by
calling him a British merchant, &amp;c., was possibly not
true, and legally, therefore, not safe. He might be
a Dane, a Russian, or a Frenchman; he was described,
therefore, in a more generalising way, as a European.
But a case so narrow as <i>that</i>&mdash;a case for pawnbrokers
and old clothesmen&mdash;ought not to regulate the
usage of great nations. Grand and spirit-stirring
(especially in a land far <i>distant</i> from home) are the
recollections of towns or provinces connected with
men's nativities. And poisonous to all such ancestral
inspirations are the rascally devices of shroffs and
money-changers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>DELHI.</h3>

<p>That man&mdash;I suppose we are all agreed&mdash;who
commanded in Meerut on Sunday the tenth day of
May, in the year of Christ one thousand eight
hundred and fifty-seven, a day which will furnish an
epoch for ever to the records of civilisation&mdash;that
man who <i>could</i> have stopped the bloody kennel of
hounds, but did <i>not</i>, racing in full cry to the homes
of our unsuspecting brothers and sisters in Delhi&mdash;it
were good for that man if he had not been born.
He had notice such as might have wakened the dead
early in the afternoon (2 or 3 o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, I believe),
and yet, at the end of a long summer day, torchlight
found him barely putting his foot into the stirrup.
And why into the stirrup at all? For what end, on
what pretence, should he ever have played out the
ridiculous pantomime and mockery of causing the
cavalry to mount? Two missions there were to
execute on that fatal night&mdash;first, to save our noble
brothers and sisters at Delhi from a ruin that was
destined to be total; secondly, to inflict instant and
critical retribution upon those who had already
opened the carnival of outrage, before they left
Meerut. Oh, heaven and earth! heart so timid was
there in all this world, sense of wrong so callous,
as not to leap with frenzy of joy at so sublime a
summons to wield the most impassioned functions of
Providence&mdash;namely, hell-born destroyers to destroy
in the very instant of their fancied triumph, and
suffering innocence to raise from the dust in the very
crisis of its last despairing prostration. Reader! it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>is not exaggeration&mdash;many a heart will bear witness
in silence that it is <i>not</i>&mdash;if I should say that men
exist, who would gladly pay down thirty years of life
in exchange for powers so heavenly for redressing
earthly wrongs. To the infamous torpor on that
occasion, and the neglect of the fleeting hour that
struck the signal for delivery and vengeance, are due
many hundreds of the piteous outrages that have
since polluted Bengal. Do I mean that, if the rebel
capture of Delhi had been prevented, no subsequent
outrages would have followed? By no means. Other
horrors would have been perpetrated; but that first
and greatest (always excepting the case of Cawnpore)
would by all likelihood have been intercepted.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>But perhaps his military means were inadequate to
the crisis? He had duties to Meerut, not less than
duties of vengeance and of sudden deliverance for
Delhi. True: he had so; and he had means for
meeting all these duties. He had a well-mounted
establishment of military force, duly organized in all
its arms. Three-and-twenty hundreds he had of
British, suitably proportioned as to infantry, cavalry,
and artillery&mdash;a little army that would have faced
anything that Delhi could at that time have put
forward. Grant that Delhi could have mustered 5000
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>men: these are three propositions having no doubtful
bearing upon such a fact:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That cheerfully would this little British force
have faced any Asiatic force of 5000 men, which,
indeed, it can hardly be necessary to say, in the face
of so large and so transcendent an experience.</p>

<p>2. That the Delhi force, could have reached the
amount supposed of 5000 only after a junction with
the Meerut mutineers; which junction it was the
main business of the Meerut commander to intercept.</p>

<p>3. That this computation assumes also the whole of
the Delhi garrison to be well affected to the mutineers;
an assumption altogether unwarrantable on
the <i>outside</i> of Delhi during the 10th and 11th of
May.</p>

<p>Such were (1) the <i>motives</i> of the commander at
Meerut towards a noble and energetic resolution;
such were (2) his <i>means</i>.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Thinking of that vile <i>lachet&eacute;</i>, which surrendered,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>with a girl's tameness, absolutely suffered to lapse,
without effort, and as if a bauble, this great arsenal
and magazine into the hands of the revolters, involuntarily
we have regarded it all along as a deadly misfortune;
and, upon each periodic mail, the whole
nation has received the news of its non-capture as a
capital disappointment.</p>

<p>But, on steadier consideration, apparently all this
must be regarded as a very great error. Not that it
could be any error to have wished for any course of
events involving the safety of our poor slaughtered
compatriots. That event would have been cheap at
<i>any</i> price. But that dismal catastrophe <i>having</i> happened,
to intercept that bitter wo having been already
ripened into an impossibility by the 11th and 12th of
May, seven-and-forty days before our thoughts at
home began to settle upon India, thenceforwards it
became a very great advantage&mdash;a supreme advantage&mdash;that
Delhi should have been occupied by the mutineers.
Briefly, then, why?</p>

<p>First of all, because this movement shut up within
one ring fence the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the rebels (according to some
calculations, at least three-and-twenty thousand of
well-armed and well-disciplined men), that would
otherwise have been roaming over the whole face of
Bengal as marauders and murderers. These men,
left to follow their own vagrant instincts, would, it is
true, in some not inconsiderable proportion, have
fallen victims to those fierce reactions of rustic vengeance
which their own atrocities would very soon have
provoked. But large concentrated masses would still
have survived in a condition rapidly disposable as
auxiliary bodies to all those towns invested by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>circumstances with a partisan interest, such as
Lucknow, Benares, Cawnpore, Agra, Gwalior, and
Allahabad.</p>

<p>Secondly, Delhi it was that opened the horrors of
retribution; mark what chastisement it was that
alighted from the very first upon all the scoundrels
who sought, and fancied they could not fail to find,
an asylum in Delhi. It is probable that hardly one
in twenty of the mutineers came to Delhi without
plunder, and for strong reasons this plunder would
universally assume the shape of heavy metallic money.
For the public treasuries in almost every station were
rifled; and unhappily for the comfort of the robbers
under the Bengal sun of June and July, very much
of the East Indian money lies in silver&mdash;namely,
rupees; of which, in the last generation, eight were
sufficient to make an English pound; but at present
ten are required by the evil destiny of sepoys. Everybody
has read an anecdote of the painter Correggio,
that, upon finishing a picture for some monastery,
the malicious monks paid him for it in copper. The
day of payment was hot, and poor Correggio was
overweighted; he lay down under his copper affliction;
and whether he died or not, is more than I
remember. But doubtless, to the curious in Correggiosity,
Pilkington will tell. For the sepoys, although
<i>their</i> affliction took the shape of silver, and not of
copper, virtually it was not less, considering the far
more blazing sun. Mephistopheles might have
arranged the whole affair. One could almost hear
him whispering to each separate sepoy, as he stood
amongst the treasury burglars, the reflection that
those <i>pensions</i>, which the kind and munificent English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Government granted to their old age or their infirmities,
all over India, raising up memorial trophies of
public gratitude or enlightened pity, never more
would be heard of. All had perished, the justice that
gave, the humble merit that received, the dutiful
behaviour that hoped; and henceforwards of them
and of their names, as after the earliest of rebellions,
in the book of life 'was no remembrance.'</p>

<p>Under these miserable thoughts the vast majority
of the sepoys robbed largely, as opportunities continually
opened upon them. Then, and chiefly <i>through</i>
their robberies, commenced their chastisement in
good earnest. Every soldier by every comrade was
viewed with hatred and suspicion; by the common
labourer with the scrutiny of deep self-interest. The
popular report of their sudden wealth travelled
rapidly; every road, village, house, whether ahead or
on their flanks, became a place of distrust and anxious
jealousy; and Delhi seemed to offer the only safe
asylum. Thither, as to a consecrated sanctuary, all
hurried; and their first introduction to the duties of
the new home they had adopted, would be a harsh
and insolent summons to the chances of a desperate
<i>sortie</i> against men in whose presence their very souls
sank. On reviewing the circumstances which <i>must</i>
have surrounded this Delhi life, probably no nearer
resemblance to a hell of apostate spirits has ever
existed. Money, carried in weighty parcels of coin,
cannot be concealed. Swathed about the person, it
disfigures the natural symmetries of the figure. The
dilemma, therefore, in which every individual traitor
stood was, that, if he escaped a special notice from
every eye, this must have been because all his crimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>had failed to bring him even a momentary gain.
Having no money, he had no swollen trousers. For
ever he had forfeited the pension that was the pledge
of comfort and respectability to his family and his
own old age. This he had sacrificed, in exchange for&mdash;nothing
at all. But, on the other hand, if his
robberies had been very productive and prosperous,
in that proportion he became advertised to every eye,
indicated and betrayed past all concealment to every
ruffian less fortunate as a pillager. Delhi must in
several points have ripened his troubles, and showed
them on a magnifying disk. To have no confidential
friend, or adviser, or depositary of a secret, is an
inevitable evil amongst a population constitutionally
treacherous. But now in Delhi this torment takes a
more fearful shape. Every fifth or sixth day, when
he is sternly ordered out upon his turn of duty, what
shall he do with his money? He has by possibility
40 lbs. weight of silver, each pound worth about three
guineas. In the very improbable case of his escaping
the gallows, since the British Government will endeavour
to net the whole monstrous crew that have
one and all broken the <i>sacramentum militare</i>, for
which scourging with rods and subsequent strangulation
is the inevitable penalty, what will remain to his
poor family? His cottage, that once had been his
pride, will now betray him, as soon as ever movable
columns are formed, and horse-patrols begin to inspect
the roads. But, as to his money, in nineteen cases
out of twenty, he will find himself obliged to throw it
away in his flight, and will then find that through
three months of intolerable suffering he has only been
acting as steward for some British soldier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>The private letters and the local newspapers from
many parts of India having now come in, it is possible
through the fearful confusion to read some facts that
would cause despair, were it not for two remembrances:
first, what nation it is that supports the
struggle; secondly, that of the six weeks immediately
succeeding to the 10th of September, no two days, no
period of forty-eight hours, <i>can</i> pass without continued
successions of reinforcements reaching Calcutta. It
should be known that even the worst sailers among
the transports&mdash;namely, exactly those which were
despatched from England through the course of <i>July</i>
(not of August)&mdash;are all under contract to perform
the voyage in seventy days; whereas many a calculation
has proceeded on the old rate of ninety days.
The small detachments of two and three hundreds,
despatched on every successive day of July, are already
arriving at their destination; and the August detachments,
generally much stronger (800 or 900), all
sailed in powerful steamers. Lord Elgin arrived at
Calcutta in time to be reported by this mail, with
marines (300) and others (300), most seasonably to
meet the dangers and uproars of the great Mahometan
festival. The bad tidings are chiefly these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The failure of a night-attack upon the Dinapore
mutineers by detachments from two of our British
regiments, with a loss of '200 <i>killed</i>'; in which, however,
there <i>must</i> be a mistake; for the total number
of our attacking party was only 300. On the other
hand, there may have been some call for a consciously
desperate effort; and the enemy, having two regiments,
would muster, probably, very nearly 2000
men; for the sepoy regiments are always strong in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>numbers, and these particular regiments had not
suffered.</p>

<p>2. Much more ominous than these reports, is an
estimate of our main force before Delhi at less than
2000 men. This, unhappily, is not intrinsically
improbable. The force was, by many persons, never
reckoned at more than 6000 or 7000 men; and this,
when reduced by three-and-twenty conflicts (perhaps
more), in which the enemy had the advantage of
artillery more powerful than ours, and (what is worse)
of trained artillerymen more numerous, might too
naturally come down to the small number stated.</p>

<p>3. The doubtful condition of Lucknow, Benares,
and Agra comes in the rear of all this to strike a
frost into the heart, or would do so, again I say, if
any other nation were concerned.</p>

<p>4. Worse still, because reluctantly unfolding facts
that had previously been known and kept back, is
the state of Bombay. When retreats on board the
shipping are contemplated, or at least talked of, the
mere insulated case of Kolapore becomes insignificant.</p>

<p>5. I read a depressing record in the very quarter
whence all our hopes arise. In summing up the
particular transports throughout July whose destination
was Calcutta, I find that the total of troops
ordered to that port in the thirty-one days of July
was just 6500, and no more. Every place was rapidly
becoming of secondary importance in comparison of
the area stretching with a radius of 150 miles in every
direction from the centre of Allahabad. And the
one capital danger is too clearly this&mdash;that, being
unable to throw in <i>overwhelming</i> succours, those
inadequate succours, matched against the countless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>resources of Hindoo vagrant ruffianism, may, at the
utmost, enable us to keep a lingering hold, whilst
endless successions of incomparably gallant men fall
before our own rifles, our own guns, and that discipline
of a cowardly race which we ourselves have
taught. We are true to ourselves, and ever shall
be so: that is a rock to build upon. Yet, if it
should appear by January next that no deep impression
has then been made upon revolting India, it will
probably appear the best course to send no more
rivulets of aid; but to <i>combine</i> measures energetically
with every colony or outpost of the empire; to call
up even the marines and such sections of our naval
forces as have often co-operated with the land forces
(in the Chinese war especially); and to do all this
with a perfect disregard of money. Lord Palmerston
explained very sufficiently why it is that any powerful
squadrons of ships, which would else have rendered
such overwhelming succour against the towns along
the line of the Ganges and Jumna, were unhappily
disqualified for action, by the shallows and sand-banks
on those great rivers. But this apology does not
stand good as regards flotillas of gunboats or rafts
with a very light draught of water; still less as regards
the seamen and marines.</p>

<p>I conclude with these notices&mdash;too painfully entitled
to some attention. Would to heaven they were <i>not</i>!</p>

<p>1. Calcutta itself is not by any means in a state of
<i>security</i>, either in the English sense of that word
(namely, freedom from danger), or in its old Latin
sense of freedom from the <i>anxieties</i> of danger. All
depends upon the prosperity of our affairs at Delhi,
Lucknow, Agra, Cawnpore, and Allahabad. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>possibility of a fanatical explosion, such as that which
occurred recently at Patna, shows the inefficiency of
our precautions and pretended police. I believe that
the <i>native</i> associations formed in Calcutta will be of
little use. Either the members will be sleeping at
the moment of outbreak, or will be separated from
their arms. We are noble in our carelessness; our
enemy is base, but his baseness, always in alliance
with cunning and vigilance, tells cruelly against us.</p>

<p>2. It may be feared that the Governor-General has
in the following point lamentably neglected a great
duty of his place. It must have been remarked
with astonishment, as a matter almost inexplicable,
how it has arisen that so many gallant men, at the
head of every regiment, should have suffered themselves
to be slaughtered like sheep in a butcher's
shambles. Surely five-and-twenty or thirty men, in
youthful vigour, many of them capital shots, could
easily have shot down 150 of the cowardly sepoys.
So much work they could have finished with their
revolvers. More than one amongst the ladies, in this
hideous struggle, have shot down their two brace of
black scoundrels apiece. But the officers, having the
advantage of swords, would have accounted for a few
score more. Why, then, have they not done this?&mdash;an
act of energy so natural to our countrymen when
thus roused to unforgiving vengeance. Simply because
they have held themselves most nobly, and in
defiance of their own individual interest, to be under
engagements of fidelity to the Company, and obligations
of forbearance to the dogs whom they commanded,
up to the last moment of possible doubt. Now, from
these engagements of honour the Governor-General
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>should, by one universal act (applicable to the three
Presidencies) have absolved them. For it cannot be
alleged <i>now</i> for an instant, that perhaps the regiments
might mean to continue faithful. If they <i>do</i> mean
this, no harm will come to any party from the official
dispensing order; the sepoys could suffer by it only
in the case of treachery. And, in the meantime, there
has emerged amongst them a new policy of treason,
which requires of us to assume, in mere self-defence,
that <i>all</i> sepoys are meditating treason. It is this:
they now reserve their final treason until the critical
moment of action in the very crisis of battle. Ordered
to charge the revolters, they discharge their carbines
over their heads; or, if infantry, they blaze away
with blank cartridge. This policy has been played off
already eight or nine times; and by one time, as it
happens, too many; for it was tried upon the stern
Havelock, who took away both horses and carbines
from the offenders. Too late it is <i>now</i> for Bengal to
baffle this sharper's trick. But Bombay and Madras,
should <i>their</i> turn come after all, might profit by the
experience.</p>

<p>3. For years it has been our nursery bugbear, to
apprehend a Russian invasion on the Indus. This, by
testimony from every quarter (the last being that of
Sir Roderick Murchison, who had travelled over most
of the ground), is an infinitely impossible chimera;
or at least until the Russians have colonized Khiva
and Bokhara. Meantime, to those who have suffered
anxiety from such an anticipation, let me suggest one
consolation at least amongst the many horrors of the
present scenes in Bengal&mdash;namely, that this perfidy
of our troops was not displayed first in the very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>agony of conflict with Russia, or some more probable
invader.</p>

<p>4. A dismal suggestion arises from the present
condition of Bengal, which possibly it is too late now
to regard as a warning. Ravaged by bands of
marauders, no village safe from incursion, the usual
culture of the soil must have been dangerously interrupted.
Next, therefore, comes <span class="smcap">Famine</span> (and note
that the famines of India have been always excessive,
from want of adequate carriage), and in the train of
famine, inaudibly but surely, comes cholera; and then,
perhaps, the guiltiest of races will pay down an
expiation at which centuries will tremble. For in
the grave of famishing nations treason languishes;
the murderer has no escape; and the infant with its
mother sleeps at last in peace.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;The following memoranda, more or less connected
with points noticed in the preceding paper,
but received later, seem to merit attention:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. As to the strength of our army before Delhi, it
seems, from better accounts, to be hardly less than
5000 men, of which one-half are British infantry;
and the besieged seem, by the closest inquiries, to
reach at the least 22,000 men.</p>

<p>2. Colonel Edwardes, so well known in connection
with Moultan, has published an important fact&mdash;namely,
that the sepoys <i>did</i> rely, in a very great
degree, upon the whole country rising, and that their
disappointment and despair are consequently proportionable.</p>

<p>3. A great question arises&mdash;How it was possible
for the sepoys&mdash;unquestionably not harbouring the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>smallest ill-will to the British&mdash;suddenly and almost
universally to assail them with atrocities arguing
the greatest. Even their own countrymen, with all
their childish credulity, would not be made to believe
that they really hated people with whom they had
never had any but the kindest and most indulgent
intercourse. I should imagine that the solution must
do sought in two facts&mdash;first, in the deadly ennui and
<i>t&aelig;dium</i> of sepoy life, which disposes them to catch
maniacally at any opening for furious excitement;
but, secondly, in the wish to forward the ends of the
conspiracy under Mahometan misleading. Hence, in
particular, the cruelties practised on women and
children: for they argued that, though the British
<i>men</i> would face anything in their own persons before
they would relax their hold on India, they would yet
be appalled by the miseries of their female partners
and children.</p>

<p>4. It is most unfair, undoubtedly, to attack any
man in our present imperfect state of information.
But some neglects are unsusceptible of after excuse.
One I have noticed, which cannot be denied or varnished,
in Lord Canning. Another is this:&mdash;Had he
offered 10,000 rupees (&pound;1000 sterling) for the head
of Nena Sahib, he would have got it in ten days,
besides inflicting misery on the hell-kite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<h3>SUGGESTIONS UPON THE SECRET OF THE MUTINY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>January, 1858.</i>)</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The first question arises upon the true originators,
proximate and immediate, of the mutiny&mdash;who were
they? This question ploughs deeper than any which
moves under an impulse of mere historic curiosity;
and it is practically the main question. Knowing
the true, instant, operative cause, already we know
something of the remedy;&mdash;having sure information
as to the ringleaders, we are enabled at once to read
their motives in the past, to anticipate their policy in
the future;&mdash;having the <i>persons</i> indicated, those who
first incited or encouraged the felonious agents, we
can shorten the course of public vengeance; and in
so vast a field of action can give a true direction from
the first to the pursuit headed by our Indian police.
For that should never be laid out of sight&mdash;that
against rebels whose <i>least</i> offence is their rebellion,
against men who have massacred by torture women
and children, the service of extermination belongs of
right to executioners armed with whips and rods,
with the <i>lassos</i> of South America for noosing them,
and, being noosed, with halters to hang them.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>should be made known by proclamation to the sepoys,
that <i>de jure</i>, in strict interpretation of the principle
concerned, they are hunted by the hangman; and
that the British army, whilst obliged by the vast
scale of the outrages to join in this hangman's chase,
feel themselves dishonoured, and called to a work
which properly is the inheritance of the gallows; and
yet, again, become reconciled to the work, as the
purgation of an earth polluted by the blood of the
innocent.</p>

<p>Who then, again I ask&mdash;who are those that, after
seven months' watching of the revolt, appeared, by
any plausible construction of events, to have been
the primal movers in this hideous convulsion? Individual
opinions on this question, and such as could
plead a weight of authority in regard to experience, to
local advantages for conjecture, and to official opportunities
for overlooking intercepted letters, there have
been many; and at first (say from May 10 to the end
of June), in the absence of any strong counter-arguments,
some of these were entitled to the full benefit
of their <i>personal</i> weight (such weight, I mean, as
could be drawn from the position or from the known
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>character of him who announced the opinion). But
now&mdash;namely, on the 15th of December (or, looking
to India, say the 10th of November)&mdash;we are entitled
to something weightier. And what <i>is</i> there which
generally would be held weightier? First, there are
the confessions of dying criminals;&mdash;I mean, that,
logically, we must reserve such a head, as likely to
offer itself sooner or later. Tempers vary as to obduracy,
and circumstances vary. All men will not
share in the obstinacy of partisan pride; or not, by
many degrees, equally. And again, some amongst
the many thousands who leave families will have
favours to ask. They all know secretly the perfect
trustworthiness of the British Government. And
when matters have come to a case of choice between
a wife and children, in the one scale, and a fraternity
consciously criminal, in the other, it may be judged
which is likely to prevail. What through the coercion
of mere circumstances&mdash;what through the entreaties
of wife and children, co-operating with such circumstances&mdash;or
sometimes through weakness of nature,
or through relenting of compunction&mdash;it is not to be
doubted that, as the cohesion of party begins rapidly
to relax under approaching ruin, there will be confessions
in abundance. For as yet, under the timid
policy of the sepoys&mdash;hardly ever venturing out of
cover, either skulking amongst bushy woodlands, or
sneaking into house-shelter, or slinking back within
the range of their great guns&mdash;it has naturally happened
that our prisoners have been exceedingly few.
But the decisive battle before Lucknow will tell us
another story. There will at last be cavalry to <i>reap</i>
the harvest when our soldiery have won it. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>prisoners will begin to accumulate by thousands;
executions will proceed through week after week; and
a large variety of cases will yield us a commensurate
crop of confessions. These, when they come, will tell
us, no doubt, most of what the sepoys can be supposed
to know. But, meantime, how much is <i>that</i>?
Too probably, except in the case of here and there
some specially intelligent or specially influential sepoy
officer, indispensable as a go-between to the non-military
conspirators moving in darkness behind the
rebel army, nothing at all was communicated to the
bulk of the privates, beyond the mere detail of movements
required by the varying circumstantialities of
each particular case. But of the ultimate purpose,
of the main strategic policy, or of the transcendent
interests over-riding the narrow counsels that fell
under the knowledge of the illiterate soldier, since no
part was requisite to the fulfilment of each man's
separate duty, no part would be communicated. It
is barely possible that so much light as may be won
from confessions, combined with so much further
light as may be supposed to lurk amongst the mass
of unexamined papers left behind them by the rebels
at Delhi, might tell us something important. But
any result to be expected from the Delhi papers is a
doubtful contingency. It is uncertain whether they
will ever be brought under the review of zeal united
to sagacity sufficient for sustaining a search purely
disinterested. Promising no great triumph for any
literary purpose, proving as little, perhaps, one way
or other, as the mathematician in the old story complained
that the <i>&AElig;neid</i> proved&mdash;these papers, unless
worked by an enamoured bookworm (or paperworm),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>will probably be confiscated to some domestic purpose,
of singeing chickens or lighting fires.</p>

<p>But, in any case, whether speaking by confessions
or by the varied memoranda (orders to subaltern
officers, resolutions adopted by meetings, records of
military councils, petitions, or suggestions on the
public service, addressed to the king, &amp;c.), abandoned
in the palace at Delhi, the soldier can tell no more
than he knew, which, under any theory of the case,
must have been very little. Better, therefore, than
all expectations fixed on the vile soldiery, whom, in
every sense, and in all directions, I believe to have
been brutally ignorant, and through their ignorance
mainly to have been used as blind servile instruments&mdash;better
and easier it would be to examine narrowly
whether, in the whole course and evolution of this
stupendous tragedy, there may not be found some
characterising feature or distinguishing incident,
that may secretly report the agency, and betray, by
the style and character of the workmanship, <i>who</i>
might be the particular class of workmen standing at
the centre of this unparalleled conspiracy. I think
that we stand in this dilemma: either, on the one
hand, that the miserable sepoys, who were the sole
acting managers, were also the sole contrivers of the
plot&mdash;in which case we can look for further light
only to the judicial confessions; or, on the other hand,
that an order of agents far higher in rank than any
subaltern members of our army, and who were enabled
by this rank and corresponding wealth to use
these soldiers as their dupes and tools, stood in the
background, holding the springs of the machinery in
their hands, with a view to purposes transcending by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>far any that could ever suggest themselves to persons
of obscure station, having no prospect of benefiting
by their own fullest success. In this case, we shall
learn nothing from the confessions of those who must,
upon a principle of mere self-preservation, have been
excluded from all real knowledge of the dreadful
scheme to which they were made parties, simply as
perpetrators of its murders and outrages. Here it is
equally vain to look for revelations from the mercenary
workers, who know nothing, or from the elevated
leaders, who know all, but have an interest of life
and death in dissembling their knowledge. Revelations
of any value from those who cannot, and from
those who will not, reveal the ambitious schemes
communicated to a very few, are alike hopeless. In
default of these, let us examine if any one incident,
or class of incidents, in the course of these horrors,
may not have made a self-revelation&mdash;a silent but
significant revelation, pointing the attention of men
to the true authors, and simultaneously to the final
purposes, of this mysterious conspiracy.</p>

<p>Now, it has not escaped the notice of many people
that two most extraordinary classes of outrages,
perpetrated or attempted, have marked a very large
majority of the mutinous explosions; outrages that
were in the last degree unnatural, as out of harmony
with the whole temper and spirit of intercourse
generally prevailing between the sepoys and their
British officers. The case is peculiarly striking. No
reproach on the character of their manners was ever
alleged against their British officers by any section
or subdivision of the sepoy soldiery. Indeed, the
reproach, where any existed, ran in the very opposite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>channel. Too great indulgence to the sepoy, a spirit
of concession too facile to their very whims and
caprices, and generally too relaxed a state of discipline&mdash;these
features it was of the British bearing
towards the native soldiery which too often, and
reasonably, provoked severe censures from the observing.
The very case<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> which I adduced some
months back, where an intelligent British officer, in
the course of his evidence before some court-martial,
mentioned, in illustration of the decaying discipline,
that for some considerable space of time he had
noticed a growing disrespect on the part of the
privates; in particular, that, on coming into the cantonments
of his own regiment, the men had ceased to
rise from their seats, and took no notice of his presence&mdash;this
one anecdote sufficiently exemplified the
quality of the errors prevailing in the deportment of
our countrymen to their native soldiery; and that it
would be ludicrous to charge them with any harshness
or severity of manner. Such being too notoriously
the case, whence could possibly arise the bloody carnage
by which, in almost every case, the sepoys
inaugurated, or tried to inaugurate, their emancipation
from British rule? Our continental neighbours
at first grossly misinterpreted the case; and more
excusably than in many other misinterpretations.
Certainly it was unavoidable at first to read, in this
frenzy of bloodshed, the vindictive retaliations of men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>that had suffered horrible and ineffable indignities at
our hands. It was apparently the old case of African
slaves in some West Indian colony&mdash;St. Domingo, for
instance&mdash;breaking loose from the yoke, and murdering
(often with cruel torments) the whole households
of their oppressors. But a month dissipated these
groundless commentaries. The most prejudiced
Frenchman could not fail to observe that no sepoy
regiment ever alluded to any rigour of treatment,
or any haughtiness of demeanour. His complaints
centred in the one sole subject of religion; even as
to which he did not generally pretend to any certain
knowledge, but simply to a very strong belief or
persuasion that we secretly meditated, not that we
openly avowed or deliberately pursued, a purpose of
coercing him into Christianity. This, were it even
true, though a false and most erroneous policy, could
not be taxed with ill-will. A man's own religion, if
it is sincerely such, is that which he profoundly
believes to be the truth. Now, in seeking to inoculate
another with that which sincerely he believes to
be eminently the truth, though proceeding by false
methods, a man acts in a spirit of benignity. So that,
on all hands, the hellish fury of the sepoy was felt to
be unnatural, artificially assumed, and, by a reasonable
inference, was held to be a mask for something
else that he wished to conceal. But what? What
was that something else which he wished to conceal?
The sepoy simulated, in order that he might dissimulate.
He pretended a wrong sustained, that he might
call away attention from a wrong which he designed.
At this point I (and no doubt in company with
multitudes beside that had watched the case) became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>sensible of an alien presence secretly intruding into
this pretended quarrel of the native soldier. It was
no sepoy that was moving at the centre of this feud:
the objects towards which it ultimately tended were
not such as could by possibility interest the poor,
miserable, idolatrous native. What was <i>he</i> to gain
by the overthrow of the British Government? The
poor simpleton, who had been decoyed into this
monstrous field of strife, opened the game by renouncing
all the vast advantages which he and his
children to the hundredth generation might draw
from the system of the Company, and entered upon a
career towards distant objects that for <i>him</i> have
absolutely no meaning or intelligible existence. At
this point it was that two enigmas, previously insoluble,
suddenly received the fullest explanation:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. What was the meaning of that hellish fury
suddenly developed towards officers with whom previously
the sepoy had lived on terms of reciprocal
amity?</p>

<p>2. What cause had led to that incomprehensible
enmity manifested, in the process of these ferocious
scenes, towards the wives and children of the officers?
Surely, if his wish were to eliminate their families
from the Indian territory, that purpose was sufficiently
secured by the massacre of him whose
exertions obtained a livelihood for the rest of the
household.</p>

<p>It was tolerably certain that the widows and their
children would not remain much longer in the Indian
territory, when it no longer offered them an asylum
or a livelihood. Now, since personally, and viewed
apart from their husbands, these ladies could have no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>interest for the murdering sepoys, it became more
and more unintelligible on what principle, steady
motive, or fugitive impulse, these incarnate demons
could persist in cherishing any feeling whatever to
those poor, ruined women, who, when their anchorage
should be cut away by the murder of their husbands,
would become mere waifs and derelicts stranded upon
the Indian shores.</p>

<p>These had seemed at first two separate mysteries
not less hard to decipher than the primal mystery of
the mutiny itself. But now all became clear; whatsoever
might be the composition, or character, or
final objects of that tyranny which had decoyed the
sepoys under its yoke, one thing was certain&mdash;namely,
that the childishness and levity of the Hindoo sepoy
made it difficult in excess to gain any lasting hold
over his mind, or consequently to count upon his
lasting services. But to this general difficulty there
had now supervened one signal aggravation, in a
shape hateful to those who encountered it&mdash;namely,
the attractions of the British service, which service
would be no sooner abjured than it would be passionately
regretted. Here lay the rock which threatened
the free movement of the insurrection. It was
evidently determined by those who meant to appropriate
the services of the sepoys, that they should have
no retreat, no opening for recovering a false step, in
the well-known mercy of the British Government.
For <i>them</i> it was resolved that there should be no
<i>locus penitenti&aelig;</i> left open. In order to close for ever
that avenue to all hope of forgiveness, the misleaders
of the soldiery urged them into those atrocities which
every nation upon earth has heard of with horror.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
The mere fact of these atrocities indicates at once the
overruling influence of such men as Nena Sahib,
determined to place a bar of everlasting separation
between the native army and that government which
might else have reclaimed the erring men, had their
offences lain within the reach of lawful forgiveness.
The conspirators having thus divorced the ruling
power, as they idly flattered themselves, from all
martial resources, doubtless assumed the work of
revolution already finished by midsummer-day of this
present year. And this account of the course through
which that attempted revolution travelled&mdash;according
to which, not the sepoys, who could have had no
ambition such as is implied in that attempt, but Indian
princes and rajahs, standing in the background,
were the true originators of the movement&mdash;finds
an indirect justification of its own accuracy in the
natural solution which it furnishes to those infernal
massacres, which else, as they must remain for ever
without a parallel, will also remain for ever without
an intelligible motive. These atrocities were exacted
from the sepoys by the conclave of princes as tests of
their sincerity. Such doubtless was the argument
for this exaction, the ostensible plea put forward to
the miserable reptiles who were seduced into this
treason, by the promise no doubt of sharing in the
fruits of the new and mighty revolution. Such pleas
were for the sepoy. But for himself and his own
secret benefit the princely seducer needed all that he
could obtain of such accursed acts, as the means sure
and sudden of making the separation between the
soldier and the government more and more irreparable.</p>

<p>So much for the massacre of his officers: but a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>different reason availed for the more diabolical outrages
upon women and their children. The murder
of the <i>men</i> was extorted from the sepoy as a kind
of sacrifice. With <i>them</i> the reptile had lived upon
terms of humanising intercourse; and, vile as he
was, in many cases this must have slowly ripened
into some mode of regard and involuntary esteem; so
that, in murdering the man, oftentimes a sepoy was
making a real (if trifling) sacrifice. But for females
he cared nothing at all. And in my opinion they
perished on a very different principle. The male
murders were levied as pledges for the benefit of the
princes, and very distinctly understood to be levied
<i>against</i> the wishes of the sepoy. But in the female
sacrifice all parties concurred&mdash;sepoy and prince,
tempted and tempter alike. I require you to murder
this officer, as a pledge of your real hostility (which
else might be a pure pretence) to the government.
But the murder of the officer's wife and child rested
on a motive totally different&mdash;namely, this:&mdash;Throughout
Hindostan no feature in the moral aspects of the
British nature could have been so conspicuous or so
impressive as the tenacity of purpose, the persistency,
and the dogged resolution never to relax a grasp once
taken. Consequently, had the <i>men</i> of our nation,
and they separately from the women, scattered themselves
here and there over the land (as they have
long done in China, for instance), then, perhaps, the
natives, when finding themselves in conflict with this
well-known principle of imperishable tenacity, would
be liable to a sentiment of despair, as in a contest
with fate. And that sentiment would paralyse the
Hindoos when entering upon a struggle for unrooting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>the British from Hindostan. But here suddenly,
Woman steps in to aid the Hindoo. For the Briton,
it is notorious, would never loosen his hold, more
than his compatriot the bull-dog. But that scene
which a man had faced steadily upon his own account,
he shrinks from as a husband or a father. Hence
the sepoy attacks upon women and children.</p>

<p>From hurried writing, it is to be feared that I may
have done slight justice to my own views. Let me
conclude this head therefore by briefly <i>resuming</i>.</p>

<p>The argument for tracing back the great conspiracy
to the discontented rajahs is&mdash;that otherwise, and
supposing the mutiny raised for objects specially
affecting the sepoys, they would <i>not</i> have massacred
their officers. <i>They</i> must have desired to leave an
opening for pardon in the event of failure. That
crime was exacted to compromise the native army
effectually with the government. But this in many
ways was sure to operate ruinously for the sepoy
interests, and could therefore have found a sufficient
motive only with the native princes.</p>

<p>But the <i>female</i> sacrifice was welcome to all parties.
For no doubt they represented the British officer
as saying:&mdash;So long as the danger affected only
myself, I would never have relaxed my hold on India;
but now, when the war threatens our women and
children, India can no longer be a home for <i>us</i>.</p>

<p>Another urgent question concerns the acts of the
Bengal Government. Many unfounded charges, as
in a case of infinite confusion and hourly pressure,
must be aimed at the Governor-General: the probability
of such charges, and the multiplied experience
of such charges, makes reasonable men cautious&mdash;in fact,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>unduly so; and the excess of caution reacts
upon Lord Canning's estimation too advantageously.
Lord Dalhousie is missed; his energy would have
shown itself conspicuously by this time. For surely
in such a case as the negotiation with Bahadoor Jung
of Nepaul, as to the Ghoorkas, there can be no doubt
<i>at present</i>, though a great doubt, unfairly indulgent
to Lord Canning, was encouraged at first, that most
imbecile oscillation governed the Calcutta counsels.
And it is now settled that this oscillation turned
entirely upon a petty personal motive. A subordinate
officer had accepted the Nepaul offer, and by
that unauthorised acceptance had intruded upon the
prerogative of Lord Canning. The very same cause&mdash;this
jealous punctiliousness of exacting vanity, and
not any wish to enforce the severities of public justice&mdash;interfered
to set aside the proclamation of Mr.
Colvin at Agra. The insufficiency again of the steps
taken as to Nena Sahib speaks the same language.
In this very journal, full six weeks earlier than in
the Calcutta proclamation, the offer of a large sum<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
for this man's head had been suggested. That offer
was never kept sufficiently before the public eye.
But a grosser neglect than this, as affecting the condition
of many thousands, and not of any single
villain, was the non-employment of the press in pursuing
the steps of the mutineers. Everywhere, as
fast as they appeared in any strength, brief handbills
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>should have been circulated&mdash;circumstantially relating
their defeats, exposing their false pretences,
and describing their prospects. Once only the
government attempted such a service; and blundered
so far as to urge against the sepoys a reproach which
must have been unintelligible both to them and to
all native readers.</p>

<p>Again, a question even more practical and instant
arises as to the modes of public vengeance.</p>

<p>1. If, when finally defeated, and in a military sense
destroyed, on some signal field of battle, the mutineers
should fly to the hills in the great ranges, or
the jungle, the main fear would arise not from
<i>them</i>, but from the weak compromising government,
that would show itself eager to treat, and make what
the Roman law calls a <i>transactio</i>, or half-and-half
settlement with any body of sepoys that showed a
considerable strength. But, in such a case, besides
that the rebels, having now no Delhi, will have
scanty ammunition, our best resource would be found
in the Spanish bloodhounds of Cuba, which we British
used fifty years back for hunting down the poor negro
Maroons in Jamaica, who were not by a thousand
degrees so criminal as the sepoys.</p>

<p>2. That no wrong is done to the Bengal Government
by this anticipation of an eventual compromise,
may be judged by the assertion (resting apparently
on adequate authority), that even at this hour that
government are making it a subject for deliberation
and doubt&mdash;whether the sepoys have forfeited
their pensions! Doubtless, the Delhi and Cawnpore
exploits merit good-service pensions for life!</p>

<p>3. Others by millions, who come to these questions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>in a far nobler spirit, fear that at any rate, and with
every advantage for a righteous judgment, too many
of the worst sepoys laden with booty may find means
to escape. To these I would suggest that, after all,
the appropriate, worst, and most hellish of punishments
for hellish malefactors, is mortification and
utter ruin in every one of their schemes. What is
the thrust of a bayonet or the deepest of sabre-cuts?
These are over in a few moments. And I with others
rejoiced therefore that so many escaped from Delhi
for prolonged torment. That torment will be found
in the ever-rankling deadly mortification of knowing
that in all things they and their wicked comrades
have failed; and that in the coming spring, and
amongst the resurrections of spring, when all will be
finished, and the mighty storm will have wheeled
away, there remains for the children of hell only this
surviving consciousness&mdash;that the total result has
been the awakening of our Indian Government, and
the arming it for ever against a hideous peril, that
might else have overwhelmed it unprepared in an
hour of slumbering weakness. Such a game is played
but once; and, having failed, never again can it be
repeated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>A false ridicule has settled upon Novels, and upon
Young Ladies as the readers of novels. Love, we are
told authoritatively, has not that importance in the
actual practice of life&mdash;nor that extensive influence
upon human affairs&mdash;which novel-writers postulate,
and which the interest of novels presumes. Something
to this effect has been said by an eminent
writer; and the law is generally laid down upon
these principles by cynical old men, and envious blue-stockings
who have outlived their personal attractions.
The sentiment however is false even for the present
condition of society; and it will become continually
<i>more</i> false as society improves. For what is the great
commanding event, the one sole revolution, in a
woman's life? Marriage. Viewing her course from
the cradle to the grave in the light of a drama, I am
entitled to say that her wedding-day is its catastrophe&mdash;or,
in technical language, its <i>peripeteia</i>: whatever
else is important to her in succeeding years has its
origin in that event. So much for <i>that</i> sex. For the
other, it is admitted that Love is not, in the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>exclusive sense, the governing principle under which
their lives move: but what then are the concurrent
forces, which sometimes happen to co&ouml;perate with
that agency&mdash;but more frequently disturb it? They
are two; Ambition, and Avarice. Now for the vast
majority of men&mdash;Ambition, or the passion for personal
distinction, has too narrow a stage of action, its
grounds of hope are too fugitive and unsteady, to
furnish any durable or domineering influence upon
the course of life. Avarice again is so repulsive to
the native nobility of the human heart, that it rarely
obtains the dignity of a passion: great energy of
character is requisite to form a consistent and accomplished
miser: and of the mass of men it may be said&mdash;that,
if the beneficence of nature has in some
measure raised them <i>above</i> avarice by the necessity of
those social instincts which she has impressed upon
their hearts, in some measure also they sink <i>below</i> it
by their deficiencies in that austerity of self-denial
and that savage strength of will which are indispensable
qualifications for the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of heroic miser. A
perfect miser in fact is a great man, and therefore a
very rare one. Take away then the two forces of Ambition
and Avarice,&mdash;what remains even to the male
sex as a capital and overruling influence in life,
except the much nobler force of Love? History confirms
this view: the self-devotions and the voluntary
martyrdoms of all other passions collectively have
been few by comparison with those which have been
offered at the altar of Love. If society should ever
make any great advance, and man as a species grow
conspicuously nobler, Love also will grow nobler;
and a passion, which at present is possible in any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>elevated form for one perhaps in a hundred, will then
be co&euml;xtensive with the human heart.</p>

<p>On this view of the grandeur which belongs to the
passion of Sexual Love in the economy of life, as it is
and as it may be, Novels have an all-sufficient justification;
and Novel-readers are obeying a higher and
more philosophic impulse than they are aware of.
They seek an imaginary world where the harsh hindrances,
which in the real one too often fret and
disturb the 'course of true love,' may be forced to
bend to the claims of justice and the pleadings of the
heart. In company with the agitations and the dread
suspense&mdash;the anguish and the tears, which so often
wait upon the uncertainties of earthly love, they demand
at the hands of the Novelist a final event
corresponding to the natural award of celestial wisdom
and benignity. What they are striving after, in short,
is&mdash;to realize an ideal; and to reproduce the actual
world under more harmonious arrangements. This is
the secret craving of the reader; and Novels are
shaped to meet it. With what success, is a separate
and independent question: the execution cannot prejudice
the estimate of their aim and essential purpose.</p>

<h2><a name="357" id="DE_QUINCEYS_PORTRAIT"></a>DE QUINCEY'S PORTRAIT.</h2>

<p>The only one which can be considered satisfactory
is that of which a copy is prefixed to these Volumes.
It is from a steel engraving by Frank Croll, taken at
Edinburgh from a daguerreotype by Howie in 1850.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">De Quincey's</span> own opinion of it is expressed to me
in the amusing letter which was published in <i>The
Instructor</i> (New Series, vol. vi. p. 145).</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p class="center">TO THE EDITOR OF <i>THE INSTRUCTOR</i>.<br /></p>

<p><i>September 21, 1850.</i><br /></p>

<p>My Dear Sir,&mdash;I am much obliged to you for communicating
to us (that is, to my daughters and myself)
the engraved portrait, enlarged from the daguerreotype
original. The engraver, at least, seems to have done
his part ably. As to one of the earlier artists concerned,
viz. the sun of July, I suppose it is not
allowable to complain of <i>him</i>, else my daughters are
inclined to upbraid him with having made the mouth
too long. But, of old, it was held audacity to suspect
the sun's veracity:&mdash;'Solem quis dicere falsum
audeat!' And I remember that, half a century ago,
the <i>Sun</i> newspaper, in London, used to fight under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>sanction of that motto. But it was at length discovered
by the learned, that Sun <i>junior</i>, viz. the
newspaper, <i>did</i> sometimes indulge in fibbing. The
ancient prejudice about the solar truth broke down,
therefore, in that instance; and who knows but Sun
<i>senior</i> may be detected, now that our optical glasses
are so much improved, in similar practices? in which
case he may have only been 'keeping his hand in'
when operating upon that one feature of the mouth.
The rest of the portrait, we all agree, does credit to
his talents, showing that he is still wide-awake,
and not at all the superannuated old artist that
some speculators in philosophy had dreamed of his
becoming.</p>

<p>As an accompaniment to this portrait, your wish is
that I should furnish a few brief chronological memoranda
of my own life. <i>That</i> would be hard for me
to do, and <i>when</i> done, might not be very interesting
for others to read. Nothing makes such dreary and
monotonous reading as the old hackneyed roll-call,
chronologically arrayed, of inevitable facts in a man's
life. One is so certain of the man's having been born,
and also of his having died, that it is dismal to lie
under the necessity of reading it. That the man
began by being a boy&mdash;that he went to school&mdash;and
that, by intense application to his studies, 'which he
took to be <i>his</i> portion in this life,' he rose to distinction
as a robber of orchards, seems so probable, upon
the whole, that I am willing to accept it as a postulate.
That he married&mdash;that, in fulness of time, he was
hanged, or (being a humble, unambitious man) that
he was content with deserving it&mdash;these little circumstances
are so naturally to be looked for, as sown
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>broadcast up and down the great fields of biography,
that any one life becomes, in this respect, but the
echo of thousands. Chronologic successions of events
and dates, such as these, which, belonging to the race,
illustrate nothing in the individual, are as wearisome
as they are useless.</p>

<p>A better plan will be&mdash;to detach some single
chapter from the experiences of childhood, which is
likely to offer, at least, this kind of value&mdash;either
that it will record some of the deep impressions under
which my childish sensibilities expanded, and the
ideas which at that time brooded continually over my
mind, or else will expose the traits of character that
slumbered in those around me. This plan will have
the advantage of not being liable to the suspicion of
vanity or egotism; for, I beg the reader to understand
distinctly, that I do not offer this sketch as deriving
any part of what interest it may have from myself,
as the person concerned in it. If the particular experience
selected is really interesting, in virtue of its
own circumstances, then it matters not to <i>whom</i> it
happened. Suppose that a man should record a
perilous journey, it will be no fair inference that he
records it as a journey performed by himself. Most
sincerely he may be able to say, that he records it
not <i>for</i> that relation to himself, but <i>in spite of</i> that
relation. The incidents, being absolutely independent,
in their power to amuse, of all personal reference,
must be equally interesting [he will say] whether
they occurred to A or to B. That is <i>my</i> case. Let
the reader abstract from <i>me</i> as a person that by
accident, or in some partial sense, may have been previously
known to himself. Let him read the sketch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>as belonging to one who wishes to be profoundly
anonymous. I offer it not as owing anything to its
connection with a particular individual, but as likely
to be amusing separately for itself; and if I make
any mistake in <i>that</i>, it is not a mistake of vanity
exaggerating the consequence of what relates to my
own childhood, but a simple mistake of the judgment
as to the power of amusement that may attach to a
particular succession of reminiscences.</p>

<p>Excuse the imperfect development which in some
places of the sketch may have been given to my
meaning. I suffer from a most afflicting derangement
of the nervous system, which at times makes it difficult
for me to write at all, and always makes me impatient,
in a degree not easily understood, of recasting
what may seem insufficiently, or even incoherently,
expressed.&mdash;Believe me, ever yours,</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Thomas de Quincey.</span><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>This letter was a preface to 'A Sketch from Childhood,'
of which the first and second parts appeared in
that Volume.</p>

<p>After this came a blank of six months&mdash;a whole
Volume containing nothing. In Volume VIII. (January,
1852), 'A Sketch from Childhood' was resumed
with the following whimsical apology. It then ran
for five months consecutively:&mdash;</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p class="center">(<i>January, 1852.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p>I understand that several readers of my <i>Sketch
from Childhood</i> have lodged complaints against me for
not having pursued it to what they can regard as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>satisfactory close. Some may have done this in a
gentle tone, as against an irreclaimable procrastinator,
amiably inclined, perhaps, to penitence, though constitutionally
incapable of amendment; but others more
clamorously, as against one faithless to his engagements,
and deliberately a defaulter. Themselves they
regard in the light of creditors, and me as a slippery
debtor, who, having been permitted to pay his debts
by instalments&mdash;three, suppose, or four:&mdash;has paid
two, and then absconded in order to evade the rest.
Certainly to this extent I go along with them myself,
that, in all cases of a tale or story moving through
the regular stages of a plot, the writer, by the act of
publishing the introductory parts, pledges himself to
unweave the whole tissue to the last. The knot that
he has tied, though it should prove a very Gordian
knot, he is bound to untie. And, if he fails to do so,
I doubt whether a reader has not a right of action
against him for having wantonly irritated a curiosity
that was never meant to be gratified&mdash;for having
trifled with his feelings&mdash;and, possibly, for having
distressed and perplexed his moral sense; as, for
instance, by entangling the hero and heroine (two
young people that can be thoroughly recommended
for virtue) in an Irish bog of misfortunes, and there
leaving them to their fate&mdash;the gentleman up to his
shoulders, and the poor lady, therefore, in all probability
up to her lips. But, in a case like the present,
where the whole is offered as a <i>sketch</i>, an action would
not lie. A sketch, by its very name, is understood
to be a fragmentary thing: it is a <i>torso</i>, which may
want the head, or the feet, or the arms, and still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>remain a marketable piece of sculpture. In buying a
horse, you may look into his mouth, but not in
buying a <i>torso</i>: for, if all his teeth have been gone
for ten centuries, which would certainly operate in
the way of discount upon the price of a horse, very
possibly the loss would be urged as a good ground
for an <i>extra</i> premium upon the torso. Besides, it is
hard to see how any proper <i>end</i> could be devised for
a paper of this nature, reciting a few incidents, sad
and gay, from the records of a half-forgotten childhood,
unless by putting the child to death; for which
d&eacute;nouement, unhappily, there was no solid historical
foundation.</p>

<p>Right or wrong, however, my accusers are entitled
to my gratitude; since in the very fact of their
anger is involved a compliment. By proclaiming
their indignation against the procrastinating or
absconding sketcher, they proclaim their interest in
the sketch; and, therefore, if any fierce Peter Peebles
should hang upon my skirts, haling me back to work,
and denouncing me to the world as a fugitive from
my public duties, I shall not feel myself called upon
to contradict him. As often as he nails me with the
charge of being a skulker from work <i>in meditatione
fug&aelig;</i>, I shall turn round and nail <i>him</i> with the
charge of harbouring an intense admiration for me,
and putting a most hyperbolical value upon my
services; or else why should he give himself so
much trouble, after so many months are gone by, in
pursuing and recapturing me? On this principle, I
shall proceed with others who may have joined the
cry of the accusers, obediently submitting to their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>pleasure, doing my best, therefore, to supply a conclusion
which in my own eyes had not seemed
absolutely required, and content to bear the utmost
severity of their censure as applied to myself, the
workman, in consideration of the approbation which
that censure carries with it by implication to the
work itself.</p>

but they are so indispensable to accurate thinking
that we are inclined to show them some indulgence; and, the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> In general usage, '<i>The antique</i>' is a phrase limited to the
expression of art; but improperly so. It is quite as legitimately
used to denote the <i>literature</i> of ancient times, in contradistinction
to the modern. As to the term <i>classical</i>, though generally
employed as equivalent to Greek and Roman, the reader
must not forget this is quite a false limitation, contradicting the
very reason for applying the word in <i>any</i> sense to literature.
For the application arose thus: The social body of Rome being
divided into six classes, of which the lowest was the sixth, it
followed that the highest was the first. Thence, by a natural
process common to most languages, those who belonged to this
highest had no number at all assigned to them. The very
absence of a number, the calling them <i>classici</i>, implied that they
belonged to <i>the</i> class emphatically, or <i>par excellence</i>. <i>The
classics</i> meant, therefore, the grandees in social consideration;
and thence by analogy in literature. But if this analogy be
transferred from Rome to Greece, where it had no corresponding
root in civic arrangement&mdash;then, by parity of reason, to all
nations.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The beauty of this famous epigram lies in the <i>form</i> of the
conception. The first had A; the second had B; and when
nature, to furnish out a third, should have given him C, she
found that A and B had already exhausted her cycle; and that
she could distinguish her third great favourite only by giving
him both A and B in combination. But the filling up of this
outline is imperfect: for the A (<i>loftiness</i>) and the B (<i>majesty</i>)
are one and the same quality, under different names.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Because the Latin word <i>sublimis</i> is applied to objects
soaring upwards, or floating aloft, or at an aerial altitude, and
because the word does <i>sometimes</i> correspond to our idea of the
sublime (in which the notion of height is united with the
notion of moral grandeur), and because, in the excessive vagueness
and lawless latitudinarianism of our common Greek
Lexicons, the word &#8017;&#968;&#959;&#962; is translated, <i>inter alia</i>, by &#964;&#959; <i>sublime</i>,
<i>sublimitas</i>, &amp;c. Hence it has happened that the title of the
little essay ascribed to Longinus, &#928;&#949;&#961;&#953; &#8017;&#968;&#959;&#965;&#962;, is usually rendered
into English, <i>Concerning the sublime</i>. But the idea of the
Sublime, as defined, circumscribed, and circumstantiated, in
English literature&mdash;an idea altogether of English growth&mdash;the
<i>sublime byway of polar antithesis to the Beautiful</i>, had no existence
amongst ancient critics; consequently it could have no
expression. It is a great thought, a true thought, a demonstrable
thought, that the Sublime, as thus ascertained, and in
contraposition to the Beautiful, grew up on the basis of <i>sexual</i>
distinctions, the Sublime corresponding to the male, the
Beautiful, its anti-pole, corresponding to the female. Behold!
we show you a mystery.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> No word has ever given so much trouble to modern critics
as this very word (now under discussion) of the <i>sublime</i>. To
those who have little Greek and <i>no</i> Latin, it is necessary in the
first place that we should state what are the most obvious
elements of the word. According to the noble army of etymologists,
they are these two Latin words&mdash;<i>sub</i>, under, and <i>limus</i>,
mud. Oh! gemini! who would have thought of groping for
the sublime in such a situation as that?&mdash;unless, indeed, it were
that writer cited by Mr. Coleridge, and just now referred to by
ourselves, who complains of frivolous modern readers, as not
being able to raise and sequester their thoughts to the abstract
consideration of dung. Hence it has followed, that most people
have quarrelled with the etymology. "Whereupon the late Dr.
Parr, of pedantic memory, wrote a huge letter to Mr. Dugald
Stewart, but the marrow of which lies in a nutshell, especially
being rather hollow within. The learned doctor, in the first
folio, grapples with the word <i>sub</i>, which, says he, comes from
the Greek&mdash;so much is clear&mdash;but from what Greek, Bezonian?
The thoughtless world, says he, trace it to &#8017;&#960;&#959; (hypo), sub, <i>i. e.</i>
under; but I, Ego, Samuel Parr, the Birmingham doctor, trace
it to &#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961; (hyper), super, <i>i. e.</i> above; between which the difference
is not less than between a chestnut horse and a horse-chestnut.
To this learned Parrian dissertation on mud, there
cannot be much reasonably to object, except its length in the
first place; and, secondly, that we ourselves exceedingly doubt
the common interpretation of <i>limus</i>. Most unquestionably, if
the sublime is to be brought into any relation at all to mud, we
shall all be of one mind&mdash;that it must be found <i>above</i>. But to
us it appears&mdash;that when the true modern idea of mud was in
view, <i>limus</i> was not the word used. Cicero, for instance, when
he wishes to call Piso 'filth, mud,' &amp;c. calls him <i>C&aelig;num</i>: and,
in general, <i>limus</i> seems to have involved the notion of something
adhesive, and rather to express <i>plaister</i>, or artificially
prepared cement, &amp;c., than that of filth or impure depositions.
Accordingly, our own definition differs from the Parrian, or
Birmingham definition; and may, nevertheless, be a Birmingham
definition also. Not having room to defend it, for the
present we forbear to state it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> There is a difficulty in assigning any term as comprehensive
enough to describe the Grecian heroes and their antagonists,

described sufficiently as Theban captains; but, to say <i>Trojan</i>
chieftains, would express only the heroes of one side; <i>Grecian</i>,

greater, of being under no limitation as to time. This difficulty
must explain and (if it can) justify our collective phrase of the
Paladins of the Troad.</p></div>

and origin of this phrase to non-classical readers, it must be
understood that, originally, it was used by Homer to express the
few, rapid, and significant words which conveyed some hasty
order, counsel, or notice, suited to any sudden occasion or
emergency: <i>e. g.</i> 'To him flying from the field the hero addressed
these winged words&mdash;"Stop, coward, or I will transfix
thee with my spear."' But by Horne Tooke, the phrase was
adopted on the title-page of his <i>Diversions of Purley</i>, as a pleasant
symbolic expression for all the non-significant particles, the
<i>articuli</i> or joints of language, which in his well-known theory
are resolved into abbreviations or compendious forms (and
therefore rapid, flying, <i>winged</i> forms), substituted for significant
forms of greater length. Thus, <i>if</i> is a non-significant particle,
but it is an abbreviated form of an imperative in the second
person&mdash;substituted for gif, or give, or grant the case&mdash;put the
case that. All other particles are shown by Horne Tooke to be
equally shorthand (or <i>winged</i>) substitutions.</p></div>

omitted to take any notice of the recent controversy between
this gentleman&mdash;Mr. Godwin&mdash;and Mr. Booth; my reason for
which was&mdash;that I have not yet found time to read it. But, if
Mr. Lowe has rightly represented this principle of Mr. Booth's
argument in his late work on the Statistics of England, it is a
most erroneous one: for Mr. Booth is there described as alleging
against Mr. Malthus that, in his view of the tendencies of the
principle of population, he has relied too much on the case of
the United States&mdash;which Mr. Booth will have to be an extreme
case, and not according to the general rule. But of what consequence
is this to Mr. Malthus? And how is he interested in
relying on the case of America rather than that of the oldest
European country? Because he assumes a perpetual nisus in
the principle of human increase to pass a certain limit, he does
not therefore hold that this limit ever <i>is</i> passed either in the
new countries or in old (or only for a moment, and inevitably
to be thrown back within it). Let this limit be placed where
it may, it can no more be passed in America than in Europe;
and America is not at all more favourable to Mr. Malthus's
theory than Europe. Births, it must be remembered, are more
in excess in Europe than in America: though they do not make
so much positive addition to the population.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> What other interpretation? An interpretation which makes
Mr. Hazlitt's argument coincide with one frequently urged
against Mr. Malthus&mdash;viz. 'that in fact he himself relies practically
upon <i>moral restraint</i> as one great check to Population,
though denying that any great revolution in the moral nature
of man is practicable.' But so long as Mr. Malthus means, by
a <i>great revolution</i>, a revolution in the sense which he imputes to
Mr. Godwin&mdash;to Condorcet, &amp;c. viz. a revolution amounting to
absolute perfection, so long there is no logical error in all this:
Mr. Malthus may consistently rely upon moral restraint for
getting rid, suppose, of ninety cases out of every hundred which
at present tend to produce an excessive population, and yet
maintain that even this tenth of the former excess would be
sufficient, at a certain stage of population, to reproduce famines,
&amp;c., <i>i. e.</i> to reproduce as much misery and vice as had been got
rid of. Here there is an absolute increase of moral restraint,
but still insufficient for the purpose of preventing misery, &amp;c.
For, as soon as the maximum of population is attained, even
one single birth in excess (<i>i. e.</i> which does more than replace
the existing numbers)&mdash;<i>&agrave; fortiori</i>, then, one-tenth of the present
excess (though implying that the other nine-tenths had been
got rid of by moral restraint) would yet be sufficient to prevent
the attainment of a state of perfection. And, if Mr. Malthus
had so shaped his argument, whether wrong or right&mdash;he would
not have offended in point of <i>logic</i>: his logical error lies in supposing
a state of perfection already existing and yet as brought
to nothing by this excess of births: whereas it is clear that such
an excess may operate to prevent, but cannot operate to destroy
a state of perfection; because in such a state no excess could
ever arise; for, though an excess may co-exist with a vast
increase of moral restraint, it cannot co-exist with entire and
perfect moral restraint; and nothing less than <i>that</i> is involved
in the term 'perfection.' A perfect state, which allows the
possibility of the excess here spoken of, is already an imperfect
state. Now, if Mr. Hazlitt says that this is exactly what he
means, I answer that I believe it is; because I can in no other
way explain his sixth sentence&mdash;from the words 'but it is shifting
the question' to the end of that sentence. Yet again the
seventh sentence (the last) is so expressed as to be unintelligible
to me. And all that precedes the sixth sentence, though very
intelligible, yet seems the precise objection which I have stated
above, and which I think untenable. Nay, it is still less
tenable in Mr. Hazlitt's way of putting it than as usually put:
for to represent Mr. Malthus as saying that, 'if reason should
ever get the mastery over all our actions, we shall then be
governed <i>entirely</i> by our physical appetites' (which are Mr.
Hazlitt's words), would be objected to even by an opponent of
Mr. Malthus: why '<i>entirely</i>?' why more than we are at
present? The utmost amount of the objection is this:&mdash;That,
relying so much upon moral restraint <i>practically</i>, Mr. Malthus
was bound to have allowed it more weight <i>speculatively</i>, but it
is unreasonable to say that in his ideal case of perfection Mr.
Malthus has allowed no weight at all to moral restraint: even
he, who supposes an increased force to be inconsistent with Mr.
Malthus's theory, has no reason to insist upon his meaning a
diminished force.</p></div>

answer <i>ad hominem</i>: otherwise it will be seen that I do not
regard either of the two propositions as essential to Mr. Malthus's
theory: and therefore to overthrow those propositions is not to
answer that theory. But still, if an author will insist on
representing something as essential to his theory which is not
so, and challenges opposition to it,&mdash;it is allowable to meet him
on his own ground.</p></div>

that it lodges in the pupils themselves the functions which on

blow by which it secures greater accuracy of knowledge gets rid
of a great expense in masters: for this, though a great merit, is
a derivative merit: the condition of the possibility of this advantage
lies in a still greater&mdash;viz. in the artificial <i>mechanism</i> of
the system by which, when once established, the system works
itself, and thus neutralises and sets at defiance all difference of
ability in the teachers&mdash;which previously determined the whole

Day&mdash;namely, March 25&mdash;falls uniformly on December 25, it
happens necessarily that <i>Twelfth</i> Day (the adoration of the Magi
at Bethlehem), which is the ceremonial close of Christmas, falls
upon the 5th day of January; seven days in the old, five in the
new, year.</p></div>

alone should not have been already weaned, a process of early
misery that, in modern improved practice, takes place amongst
opulent families at the age of six months; and, secondly, it
might seem equally odd that, until weaned, any infant could be
truly described as 'rosy.' I wish, however, always to be punctiliously
accurate; and I can assure my readers that, generally
speaking, the wives of labouring men (for more reasons than
one) suckle their infants for three years, to the great indignation
of medical practitioners, who denounce the practice as six times
too long. Secondly, although unweaned infants are ordinarily
pale, yet, amongst those approaching their eighteenth or twentieth
month, there are often found children as rosy as any one
can meet with.</p></div>

course, and equally the regressive or homeward-bound course,
within the compass of this one word &#948;&#953;&#945;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#962;. We in England
have a phrase which conventionally has been made to supply
the want of such an idea, but unfortunately with a limitation to
the service of the Post-office. It is the phrase <i>course of post</i>.
When a Newcastle man is asked, 'What is the course of post
between you and Liverpool?' he understands, and by a legal
decision it has been settled that he is under an obligation to
understand&mdash;What is the <i>diaulos</i>, what is the flux and reflux&mdash;the
to and the fro&mdash;the systole and diastole of the respiration&mdash;between
you and Liverpool. What is the number of hours and
minutes required for the transit of a letter from Newcastle to
Liverpool, but coupled with the return transit of the answer?
This forward and backward movement constitutes the <i>diaulos</i>:
less than this will not satisfy the law as the complex process
understood by the <i>course of post</i>. Less than this is only the half
section of a <i>diaulos</i>.</p></div>

or 1200. The <i>high</i> commissioned officers, as the captain,
lieutenant, &amp;c., are always British; but the <i>non-commissioned</i>
officers are always native Hindoos&mdash;that is, sepoys. For instance,
the <i>na&iuml;k</i>, or corporal; the <i>havildar</i>, or serjeant:&mdash;even of the
<i>commissioned</i> officers, the <i>lowest</i> are unavoidably native, on
account of the native private. Note that <i>sepoy</i>, as colloquially
it is called, but <i>sipahee</i>, as in books it is often written, does not
mean Hindoo or Hindoo soldier, but is simply the Hindoo word
for <i>soldier</i>.</p></div>

with the latter days of Shakspere.</p></div>

about 700 men of the mutineers, who might then have been
attacked at a great advantage, whilst dispersed on errands of
devastation. Contrast with these proportions the heroic exertions
of the noble Havelock&mdash;fighting battle after battle, with
perhaps never more than 1700 or 1800 British troops; and
having scarcely a gun but what he captured from the enemy.
And what were the numbers of his enemy? Five thousand in

Meerut. How? The last sentence only of his letter has any
sort of reference to the public accusation; and this sentence
replies, but not with <i>any</i> mode of argument (sound or unsound),
to a charge perfectly irrelevant, if it had ever existed&mdash;namely,
an imaginary charge against the little army assembled on
May 10 at Meerut. The short and summary answer is, that no
such imaginary charge, pure and absolute moonshine, was ever
advanced against the gallant force at Meerut.
</p><p>
Secondly, if it had, such a charge could have no bearing
whatever upon that charge, loudly preferred against the commander
of that district.
</p><p>
Thirdly, the charge has been (I presume) settled as regards
its truth, and any grounds of disputation, this way or that, by
the Governor-General. The newspapers have told us, and have
not been contradicted, that Lord Canning has dismissed this
functionary for '<i>supineness</i>.'</p></div>

<i>after</i> hanging, the criminals would be decapitated: otherwise
the threat loses its sting. It seems to be a superstition universal
amongst Southern Asiatics, unless possibly amongst the
Malay race, that to suffer any dismemberment of the body
operates disastrously upon the fate in the unseen world. And
hence, no doubt, it has arisen that the gallows is not viewed in
the light of a degrading punishment. Immunity from mutilation
compensates any ignominy which might else attend it.
Accordingly, we see in China that the innumerable victims of
the present rebellion, captured in the vast province of Quantung
by the cruel Yeh, were all beheaded by the sword in the blood-reeking
privacies of Canton. And two centuries back, when the
native dynasty was overthrown by the last Tartar invasion, the
reigning emperor (having unlimited freedom of choice) ended
his career by a halter: retiring to his orchard, he hanged both
himself and his daughter.</p></div>

that this particular mode of disrespect to their British officers

amongst the very lowest orders of our mercenary troops.</p></div>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
